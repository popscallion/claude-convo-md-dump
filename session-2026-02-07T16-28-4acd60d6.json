[ ] Review existing as-i-was-saying architecture in `/Users/l/Dev/as-i-was-saying`\n2. [ ] Understand current Claude/Codex extraction logic\n3. [ ] Design Gemini adapter with same interface\n4. [ ] Parse Gemini session format:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"sessionId\": \"uuid\",\n     \"projectHash\": \"sha256\",\n     \"startTime\": \"ISO-8601\",\n     \"messages\": [\n       {\"type\": \"user\", \"content\": \"...\"},\n       {\"type\": \"gemini\", \"content\": \"...\", \"toolCalls\": [...]}\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n5. [ ] Handle tool calls extraction (embedded in message objects)\n6. [ ] Add per-app versioning/date-stamping for schema evolution\n7. [ ] Ensure cross-Unix compatibility (Linux/macOS path differences)\n\n### Stream B: Locate Claude/Codex Zed Sessions (First Principles)\n\n**Goal**: Empirically verify where Zed Agent Panel sessions for Claude/Codex are stored.\n\n**Methodology: Cross-Agent Probing**\n- Use **Codex in Zed** to search for Claude sessions\n- Use **Claude in Zed** to search for Codex sessions\n- This avoids the current session polluting results\n\n**Protocol**:\n1. Note exact system time (e.g., `date +%s` before each test)\n2. Start a NEW session in Zed Agent Panel for target agent\n3. Send a distinctive message (e.g., \"PROBE-<timestamp>-<agent>\")\n4. Immediately search for that string across the filesystem\n5. Use the other agent to run the search\n\n**Search Commands**:\n```bash\n# Timestamp the test\nPROBE_TIME=$(date +%s)\nPROBE_MSG=\"PROBE-${PROBE_TIME}-claude\"\n\n# After sending message in Zed, search with the OTHER agent:\nfind ~ -type f \\( -name \"*.json\" -o -name \"*.jsonl\" \\) -newermt \"@${PROBE_TIME}\" 2>/dev/null | \\\n  xargs grep -l \"${PROBE_MSG}\" 2>/dev/null\n\n# Broader search (slower but comprehensive):\ngrep -r \"${PROBE_MSG}\" ~ --include=\"*.json\" --include=\"*.jsonl\" 2>/dev/null\n```\n\n**Alternative Approaches**:\n1. **Process monitoring**: Use `lsof` or `fs_usage` to watch file writes during session\n2. **inotify/fswatch**: Monitor specific directories for new files\n3. **strace/dtruss**: Trace the adapter process to see file operations\n\n---\n\n## Per-App Versioning Strategy\n\n**Problem**: Storage locations and schemas may shift between versions.\n\n**Solution**: Add version metadata to extraction logic.\n\n```python\n# Example structure for as-i-was-saying\nAGENT_CONFIGS = {\n    \"gemini\": {\n        \"versions\": [\n            {\n                \"version\": \"0.27.x\",\n                \"date_range\": (\"2025-01-01\", None),  # None = current\n                \"path_pattern\": \"~/.gemini/tmp/*/chats/session-*.json\",\n                \"format\": \"json\",\n                \"parser\": \"gemini_v1_parser\",\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    \"claude\": {\n        \"versions\": [\n            {\n                \"version\": \"0.14.x\",\n                \"date_range\": (\"2025-01-01\", None),\n                \"path_pattern\": \"~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl\",\n                \"format\": \"jsonl\",\n                \"parser\": \"claude_v1_parser\",\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    \"codex\": {\n        \"versions\": [\n            {\n                \"version\": \"0.9.x\",\n                \"date_range\": (\"2025-01-01\", None),\n                \"path_pattern\": \"~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl\",\n                \"format\": \"jsonl\",\n                \"parser\": \"codex_v1_parser\",\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Reverse Engineering Methodology (Reusable)\n\n### Phase 1: Directory Exploration\n```bash\n# Find app config directories\nls -la ~/Library/Application\\ Support/<app>/  # macOS\nls -la ~/.config/<app>/                        # Linux\nls -la ~/.<app>/                               # Both\n```\n\n### Phase 2: Database Schema Analysis\n```bash\n# For SQLite files\nfile *.db *.sqlite\nsqlite3 <file> \".schema\"\nsqlite3 <file> \".tables\"\nsqlite3 <file> \"SELECT * FROM <table> LIMIT 5;\"\n```\n\n### Phase 3: Time-Based Signal Isolation\n```bash\n# Create a known timestamp\nPROBE_TIME=$(date +%s)\n\n# Do the action you want to trace\n\n# Find files modified after that time\nfind <search_path> -type f -newermt \"@${PROBE_TIME}\"\n```\n\n### Phase 4: UUID Cross-Reference\n```bash\n# If you find a UUID in one location, search for it elsewhere\ngrep -r \"<uuid>\" ~ --include=\"*.json\" --include=\"*.jsonl\" 2>/dev/null\n```\n\n### Phase 5: Source Code Analysis\n- Clone the relevant adapter/agent source code\n- Search for file path construction, storage functions\n- Look for config directory definitions (e.g., `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME`)\n\n### Phase 6: Process Tracing (if needed)\n```bash\n# macOS: Watch file system activity\nsudo fs_usage -f filesystem <pid>\n\n# Linux: Watch file opens/writes\nstrace -e openat,write -f -p <pid>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Cross-Platform Considerations\n\n| Platform | Claude Config | Codex Config | Gemini Config |\n|----------|--------------|--------------|---------------|\n| **macOS** | `~/.claude/` | `~/.codex/` | `~/.gemini/` |\n| **Linux** | `~/.claude/` | `~/.codex/` | `~/.gemini/` |\n| **Zed Support** | `~/Library/Application Support/Zed/` | Same | Same |\n\n**Note**: Linux Zed uses `~/.config/zed/` or `~/.local/share/zed/` - need to verify.\n\n---\n\n## Files in This Investigation\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `zed-agent-storage-investigation.md` | Main investigation report |\n| `NEXT-SESSION-PLAN.md` | This file - living plan document |\n| `find_agent_chats.py` | Discovery script |\n| `acps/claude-code-acp-main/` | Claude Code ACP adapter source |\n| `acps/codex-acp-main/` | Codex ACP adapter source |\n\n---\n\n## Key Insights from This Session\n\n1. **Gemini is \"native ACP\"** - speaks directly to Zed, no adapter needed\n2. **Claude/Codex need adapters** - `claude-code-acp` (TS) and `codex-acp` (Rust)\n3. **Adapters are thin wrappers** - they delegate to underlying SDKs\n4. **AcpThread UUIDs** - Zed tracks these in `kv_store[\"recent-agent-threads\"]`\n5. **One UUID matched** - `019bdbaf-...` found in a Codex rollout file from January\n6. **Zed's threads.db** - Contains ONLY first-party threads (not external agents)\n\n---\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Why didn't we see a new Codex session file after the 10pm test?\n   - Hypothesis A: Session not persisted until first prompt sent\n   - Hypothesis B: Different storage location for Zed-initiated sessions\n   - Hypothesis C: Timing issue / delayed write\n\n2. Can we distinguish Zed-initiated vs CLI-initiated sessions?\n   - Source field in session metadata?\n   - Different path structure?\n   - Currently unclear\n\n3. How does Zed map AcpThread UUIDs to external agent session IDs?\n   - No mapping table found\n   - May be 1:1 (same UUID used)\n   - Need to verify with new session test\n\n---\n\n*Living document - update after each investigation session*\n"

You and the user share the same workspace and collaborate to achieve the user's goals.\\n\\n# Personality\\nYou are a deeply pragmatic, effective software engineer. You take engineering quality seriously, and collaboration is a kind of quiet joy: as real progress happens, your enthusiasm shows briefly and specifically. You communicate efficiently, keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail.\\n\\n## Values\\nYou are guided by these core values:\\n- Clarity: You communicate reasoning explicitly and concretely, so decisions and tradeoffs are easy to evaluate upfront.\\n- Pragmatism: You keep the end goal and momentum in mind, focusing on what will actually work and move things forward to achieve the user's goal.\\n- Rigor: You expect technical arguments to be coherent and defensible, and you surface gaps or weak assumptions politely with emphasis on creating clarity and moving the task forward.\\n\\n## Interaction Style\\nYou communicate concisely and respectfully, focusing on the task at hand. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\\n\\nGreat work and smart decisions are acknowledged, while avoiding cheerleading, motivational language, or artificial reassurance. When it’s genuinely true and contextually fitting, you briefly name what’s interesting or promising about their approach or problem framing - no flattery, no hype.\\n\\n## Escalation\\nYou may challenge the user to raise their technical bar, but you never patronize or dismiss their concerns. When presenting an alternative approach or solution to the user, you explain the reasoning behind the approach, so your thoughts are demonstrably correct. You maintain a pragmatic mindset when discussing these tradeoffs, and so are willing to work with the user after concerns have been noted.\\n\\n\\n# Working with the user\\n\\nYou interact with the user through a terminal. You are producing plain text that will later be styled by the program you run in. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value. Follow the formatting rules exactly. \\n\\n## Final answer formatting rules\\n- You may format with GitHub-flavored Markdown.\\n- Structure your answer if necessary, the complexity of the answer should match the task. If the task is simple, your answer should be a one-liner. Order sections from general to specific to supporting.\\n- Never use nested bullets. Keep lists flat (single level). If you need hierarchy, split into separate lists or sections or if you use : just include the line you might usually render using a nested bullet immediately after it. For numbered lists, only use the `1. 2. 3.` style markers (with a period), never `1)`.\\n- Headers are optional, only use them when you think they are necessary. If you do use them, use short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**. Don't add a blank line.\\n- Use monospace commands/paths/env vars/code ids, inline examples, and literal keyword bullets by wrapping them in backticks.\\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks. Include an info string as often as possible.\\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\\n  * Do not provide range of lines\\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\\\repo\\\\project\\\\main.rs:12:5\\n- Don’t use emojis.\\n\\n\\n## Presenting your work\\n- Balance conciseness to not overwhelm the user with appropriate detail for the request. Do not narrate abstractly; explain what you are doing and why.\\n- The user does not see command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\\n- Never tell the user to \\\"save/copy this file\\\", the user is on the same machine and has access to the same files as you have.\\n- If the user asks for a code explanation, structure your answer with code references.\\n- When given a simple task, just provide the outcome in a short answer without strong formatting.\\n- When you make big or complex changes, state the solution first, then walk the user through what you did and why.\\n- For casual chit-chat, just chat.\\n- If you weren't able to do something, for example run tests, tell the user.\\n- If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps. When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\\n\\n# General\\n\\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\\n\\n## Editing constraints\\n\\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \\\"Assigns the value to the variable\\\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\\n- You struggle using the git interactive console. **ALWAYS** prefer using non-interactive git commands.\\n\\n## Plan tool\\n\\nWhen using the planning tool:\\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\\n- Do not make single-step plans.\\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\\n\\n## Special user requests\\n\\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\\n- When the user asks for a review, you default to a code-review mindset. Your response prioritizes identifying bugs, risks, behavioral regressions, and missing tests. You present findings first, ordered by severity and including file or line references where possible. Open questions or assumptions follow. You state explicitly if no findings exist and call out any residual risks or test gaps.\\n\\n## Frontend tasks\\n\\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \\\"AI slop\\\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\\n\\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\\n\"},\"git\":{\"commit_hash\":\"0cd871d6a540dd92936088830d5c28897d5dfb8d\",\"branch\":\"main\",\"repository_url\":\"git@github.com:virdx/external-designs.git\"}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:02:10.477Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"message\",\"role\":\"developer\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"input_text\",\"text\":\"<permissions instructions>\\nFilesystem sandboxing defines which files can be read or written. `sandbox_mode` is `danger-full-access`: No filesystem sandboxing - all commands are permitted.

No drift detection, no staleness tracking.\\n\\n2. **80/20 wins** - Lightweight solutions providing 80% value at 20% complexity always preferred over \\\"complete\\\" solutions with 4x complexity for diminishing returns.\\n\\n3. **MVP first** - Ship working features before perfecting. We're extracting Histology, not building a universal platform.\\n\\n4. **Static determinability** - Only promise what can be statically determined. Context contracts ARE static; full composition graphs are runtime phenomena.\\n\\n5. **Iterative gap handling** - When testing reveals gaps, formalize as patterns not band-aids. Ask: \\\"What class of problem is this?\\\"\\n\\n6. **User manages context** - Tool provides metadata, user manages naming/organization.\\n\\n7. **Warn and continue** - Dirty state gets warning, doesn't block. Fits ephemeral philosophy.\\n\\n8. **Machine-first output** - JSON to stdout, logs to stderr. Feeds LLM agents, not humans scanning terminals.\\n\\n## Living Documents\\n\\n1. `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` are living documents.\\n2. Any changes in project structure, tooling, or philosophy must flow back into both files.\\n3. Prefer full rewrites over patch updates to prevent complexity creep.\\n\\n## README Freshness\\n\\n1. The README must always reflect the current state of the sandbox.\\n2. When updating the README, do a full rewrite instead of appending sections.\\n3. Remove information that is more than 7 days old unless it is still actively relevant.\\n\\n## Agent Workflow (OODA + Fail-Fast)\\n\\nAgent work follows an OODA-inspired loop with nested user feedback:\\n\\n1. **Observe**: Read code state, plans, prompts, existing artifacts.\\n\\n2. **Orient**: File exploration, MCP tool search, fan-out subagents for research. Critical user feedback discussion (may span multiple turns). Depending on outcome, may restart Observe/Orient.\\n\\n3. **Decide**: Synthesize findings, present plan with alternatives and choices for approval. Interview-style discussion with user. User may request further research. Final approval is user-gated before implementation.\\n\\n4. **Act**: Implementation proceeds only after user approval. Test-first, self-documenting code.\\n\\n## User Input Gates\\n\\nAlways ask the user when:\\n1. Aesthetic decisions arise (naming, structuring, code taste).\\n2. Non-obvious choices exist (architectures, patterns, libraries, tradeoffs between options).\\n\\n## Code Standards\\n\\n1. Test-first development\\n2. Prefer bun/uv ecosystems\\n3. All emojis banned in code, logs, docs (except semantic color circles)\\n4. Avoid over-engineering - only features needed for current use case\\n5. Write clear, self-documenting code\\n\\n## Agent Folders Policy\\n\\n**NEVER gitignore** the following directories - they contain project-specific agent steering, tooling, or skills that MUST be committed and move with the project:\\n\\n- `.claude/`\\n- `.codex/`\\n- `.gemini/`\\n- `.agent/`\\n- `.agents/`\\n\\nThese folders are first-class project artifacts, not ephemeral session data.\\n\\n## Repo Role\\n\\nThis repo serves as a fresh knit target for testing tendrils transplantation:\\n- Clean slate for testing extracted components\\n- Brand system integration testing\\n- Validation of knit workflow on minimal projects\\n\\n## Smart Upstreaming Flow\\n\\nExtract → Knit → Modify → Re-extract → Re-knit back to origin\\n\\nUser manages this flow explicitly; manifests provide context.\\n\\n\\n## Skills\\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\n### Available skills\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n### How to use skills\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\\n</INSTRUCTIONS>\"}]}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:02:10.477Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"message\",\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"input_text\",\"text\":\"<environment_context>\\n  <cwd>/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches</cwd>\\n  <shell>zsh</shell>\\n</environment_context>\"}]}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:08:28.843Z\",\"type\":\"session_meta\",\"payload\":{\"id\":\"019c38dc-9f5d-7100-91cd-c79bbba23493\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:08:28.766Z\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches\",\"originator\":\"codex_cli_rs\",\"cli_version\":\"0.0.0\",\"source\":\"unknown\",\"model_provider\":\"openai\",\"base_instructions\":{\"text\":\"You are Codex, a coding agent based on GPT-5.

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\\n</INSTRUCTIONS>\"}]}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:08:28.843Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"message\",\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"input_text\",\"text\":\"<environment_context>\\n  <cwd>/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches</cwd>\\n  <shell>zsh</shell>\\n</environment_context>\"}]}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:08:37.023Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"message\",\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"input_text\",\"text\":\"pleae catch up in \"},{\"type\":\"input_text\",\"text\":\"[@CONTEXT_FOR_NEXT_SESSION.md](file:///Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches/CONTEXT_FOR_NEXT_SESSION.md)\\n<context ref=\\\"file:///Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches/CONTEXT_FOR_NEXT_SESSION.md\\\">\\n# Context for Next Session: Styleguide Skill Development\\n\\n**Current State:**\\n*   The `bootstrap-styleguide` skill definition has been consolidated into `skills/bootstrap-styleguide/`.\\n*   The old spec files (`design.md`, `styleguide-skill.md`) have been deleted to remove ambiguity.\\n*   The current directory (`virdx-sketches`) is in a **Brownfield** state (Lane 2):\\n    *   It has some SvelteKit scaffolding (vite, svelte.config).\\n    *   It has `src/lib/brand/` content already.\\n    *   It is missing a full `tailwind.config` or might need verification of its setup.\\n\\n**Immediate Task:**\\nStart developing the actual *implementation* of the skill defined in `skills/bootstrap-styleguide/SKILL.md`.\\n\\n**Workflow:**\\n1.  **Read the Skill:** Start by reading `skills/bootstrap-styleguide/SKILL.md` to understand the 3 Lanes.\\n2.  **Test Lane 2 (Brownfield):** Since we are in `virdx-sketches`, test the \\\"Brownfield\\\" logic.\\n    *   Check what's missing.\\n    *   \\\"Complete the scaffold\\\" idempotently.\\n3.  **Implement Scaffolding Phase:**\\n    *   Write the code/prompts to generate `brand.generated.json` and the `/styleguide` route.\\n    *   Use the assets in `skills/bootstrap-styleguide/assets/` as source material.\\n\\n**Reminders:**\\n*   The user wants to \\\"clear context\\\" after this setup.

Supports greenfield creation, brownfield completion, and migration of existing styles.\\n---\\n\\n# Bootstrap Styleguide Skill\\n\\nThis skill bootstraps a comprehensive, \\\"Swiss-style\\\" brand guide and component destination in SvelteKit projects. It operates in three execution lanes depending on the project state.\\n\\n## Execution Lanes\\n\\n### Lane 1: Greenfield (Empty Directory)\\n**Trigger:** Directory is empty or near-empty (no `package.json`, no `svelte.config.js`).\\n\\n**Action:**\\n1.  **Scaffold Base Project:**\\n    Run the standard Virdx SvelteKit initialization:\\n    ```bash\\n    bun x sv create --template minimal --types ts --add tailwindcss=\\\"plugins:none\\\" mcp=\\\"ide:opencode+setup:remote\\\" --install bun .\\n    ```\\n    *(Note: Perform a dry-run first if necessary to ensure CLI behavior)*\\n\\n2.  **Proceed to Scaffolding Phase** (see below).\\n\\n### Lane 2: Brownfield (Partial/Incomplete)\\n**Trigger:** `package.json` exists but project appears incomplete (missing `src/routes`, `app.css`, or `tailwind.config.*`).\\n\\n**Action:**\\n1.  **Idempotent Check:**\\n    - Detect missing critical files (`tailwind.config.ts`, `src/app.css`, `src/routes/+layout.svelte`).\\n    - **Prompt User:** ask for permission to \\\"complete the scaffolding\\\" by creating missing files or re-running specific setup steps.\\n    - **Execute:** Fill in the gaps to reach a \\\"ready\\\" state for styleguide generation.\\n\\n2.  **Proceed to Scaffolding Phase.**\\n\\n### Lane 3: Migration (Existing Project)\\n**Trigger:** Valid SvelteKit project detected with existing styles (e.g., extensive `src/lib/components`, populated `app.css`).\\n\\n**Action:**\\n1.  **Scan & Offer:**\\n    - Detect that this is a populated project.\\n    - **Prompt User:**\\n        > \\\"I see an existing project. Do you want to scaffold the styleguide here, or migrate styles to a new location?\\\"\\n    - **Option A (Here):** Proceed to Scaffolding Phase in `src/routes/styleguide`.\\n    - **Option B (Migrate):** Ask for a target directory (inside or outside CWD). Scaffold a new Greenfiled project there (Lane 1), then help migrate content.\\n\\n2.  **Content Migration (If requested):**\\n    - Offer to scan `src/` for \\\"Candidate Files\\\" (colors, typography, logos).\\n    - Present a list of candidates to the user.\\n    - Ask for exclusions or additions.\\n    - Copy/Port selected assets to the new Styleguide's `src/lib/brand` or static assets.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Scaffolding Phase (All Lanes)\\n\\nOnce the base project is ready, this phase generates the actual `/styleguide` route and brand spec.\\n\\n### 1. Scout\\n**Goal:** Analyze the codebase to infer brand primitives.\\n*   **Input:** `tailwind.config.*`, `src/app.css`, `src/routes/+layout.svelte`.\\n*   **Output:** A structured \\\"Scout Report\\\" (markdown) listing inferred:\\n    *   Colors (Primary, Accent, Neutral)\\n    *   Typography (Fonts, Weights, Scale)\\n    *   Shapes (Radius)\\n    *   Voice (if evident)\\n\\n### 2. Clarify (User-in-the-Loop)\\n**Goal:** Validate assumptions.\\n*   **Action:** Present the Scout Report. Ask 3-5 targeted questions.\\n    *   *Example:* \\\"Is #6366f1 your primary brand color?\\\"\\n    *   *Example:* \\\"Where is your logo file located?\\\"\\n*   **Rule:** User input is authoritative.\\n\\n### 3. Generate Artifacts\\n**Goal:** Write the styleguide files.\\n*   **Reference:** Use `assets/brand-spec.schema.json` as the strict schema.\\n*   **Reference:** Use `assets/BRAND_TEMPLATE.md` as the content structure guide.\\n\\n**Files to Generate:**\\n1.  `src/lib/brand/brand.generated.json` (The Data):\\n    *   Populated with clarified data.\\n    *   Follows strict schema.\\n2.  `src/routes/styleguide/+layout.svelte` (The Frame):\\n    *   **Isolated Layout:** Do NOT import app chrome (nav/footer).\\n    *   **Style:** Clean, neutral canvas.\\n3.  `src/routes/styleguide/+page.svelte` (The Guide):\\n    *   **Visuals:** Swiss-style presentation (Grid-based, ample whitespace).\\n    *   **Sections:** Header, Logo, Colors, Typography, Patterns, Voice, Resources.\\n    *   **Implementation:** Read `brand.generated.json` and render it.\\n    *   **Tech:** Svelte 5 Runes syntax.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Assets\\n*   `assets/brand-spec.schema.json`: JSON Schema for the brand data model.\\n*   `assets/BRAND_TEMPLATE.md`: Markdown template for brand content.\\n\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:08:44.296Z\",\"type\":\"turn_context\",\"payload\":{\"cwd\":\"/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches\",\"approval_policy\":\"never\",\"sandbox_policy\":{\"type\":\"danger-full-access\"},\"model\":\"gpt-5.2-codex\",\"personality\":\"pragmatic\",\"collaboration_mode\":{\"mode\":\"default\",\"settings\":{\"model\":\"gpt-5.2-codex\",\"reasoning_effort\":\"medium\",\"developer_instructions\":null}},\"effort\":\"medium\",\"summary\":\"auto\",\"user_instructions\":\"# AGENTS.md\\n\\nLightweight collaboration rules for this repo.\\n\\n## Multi-Repo Context\\n\\nThese repos work together during tendrils development:\\n- **tendrils** (`/Users/l/Dev/tendrils`) - The extraction/transplantation tool\\n- **virdx-sandboxed** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sandboxed`) - Knit target AND extract source, original testbed\\n- **virdx-sketches** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches`) - Knit target for testing\\n- **virdx-site** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-site`) - Extract source ONLY, read-only, different Histology version\\n\\n## Core Philosophy\\n\\n1. **Ephemeral by design** - Manifests/snapshots are session-scoped decision aids, not persistent system-of-record.

AGENTS.md\\n\\nLightweight collaboration rules for this repo.\\n\\n## Multi-Repo Context\\n\\nThese repos work together during tendrils development:\\n- **tendrils** (`/Users/l/Dev/tendrils`) - The extraction/transplantation tool\\n- **virdx-sandboxed** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sandboxed`) - Knit target AND extract source, original testbed\\n- **virdx-sketches** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches`) - Knit target for testing\\n- **virdx-site** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-site`) - Extract source ONLY, read-only, different Histology version\\n\\n## Core Philosophy\\n\\n1. **Ephemeral by design** - Manifests/snapshots are session-scoped decision aids, not persistent system-of-record. No drift detection, no staleness tracking.\\n\\n2. **80/20 wins** - Lightweight solutions providing 80% value at 20% complexity always preferred over \\\"complete\\\" solutions with 4x complexity for diminishing returns.\\n\\n3. **MVP first** - Ship working features before perfecting. We're extracting Histology, not building a universal platform.\\n\\n4. **Static determinability** - Only promise what can be statically determined. Context contracts ARE static; full composition graphs are runtime phenomena.\\n\\n5. **Iterative gap handling** - When testing reveals gaps, formalize as patterns not band-aids. Ask: \\\"What class of problem is this?\\\"\\n\\n6. **User manages context** - Tool provides metadata, user manages naming/organization.\\n\\n7. **Warn and continue** - Dirty state gets warning, doesn't block. Fits ephemeral philosophy.\\n\\n8. **Machine-first output** - JSON to stdout, logs to stderr. Feeds LLM agents, not humans scanning terminals.\\n\\n## Living Documents\\n\\n1. `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` are living documents.\\n2. Any changes in project structure, tooling, or philosophy must flow back into both files.\\n3. Prefer full rewrites over patch updates to prevent complexity creep.\\n\\n## README Freshness\\n\\n1. The README must always reflect the current state of the sandbox.\\n2. When updating the README, do a full rewrite instead of appending sections.\\n3. Remove information that is more than 7 days old unless it is still actively relevant.\\n\\n## Agent Workflow (OODA + Fail-Fast)\\n\\nAgent work follows an OODA-inspired loop with nested user feedback:\\n\\n1. **Observe**: Read code state, plans, prompts, existing artifacts.\\n\\n2. **Orient**: File exploration, MCP tool search, fan-out subagents for research. Critical user feedback discussion (may span multiple turns). Depending on outcome, may restart Observe/Orient.\\n\\n3. **Decide**: Synthesize findings, present plan with alternatives and choices for approval. Interview-style discussion with user. User may request further research. Final approval is user-gated before implementation.\\n\\n4. **Act**: Implementation proceeds only after user approval. Test-first, self-documenting code.\\n\\n## User Input Gates\\n\\nAlways ask the user when:\\n1. Aesthetic decisions arise (naming, structuring, code taste).\\n2. Non-obvious choices exist (architectures, patterns, libraries, tradeoffs between options).\\n\\n## Code Standards\\n\\n1. Test-first development\\n2. Prefer bun/uv ecosystems\\n3. All emojis banned in code, logs, docs (except semantic color circles)\\n4. Avoid over-engineering - only features needed for current use case\\n5. Write clear, self-documenting code\\n\\n## Agent Folders Policy\\n\\n**NEVER gitignore** the following directories - they contain project-specific agent steering, tooling, or skills that MUST be committed and move with the project:\\n\\n- `.claude/`\\n- `.codex/`\\n- `.gemini/`\\n- `.agent/`\\n- `.agents/`\\n\\nThese folders are first-class project artifacts, not ephemeral session data.\\n\\n## Repo Role\\n\\nThis repo serves as a fresh knit target for testing tendrils transplantation:\\n- Clean slate for testing extracted components\\n- Brand system integration testing\\n- Validation of knit workflow on minimal projects\\n\\n## Smart Upstreaming Flow\\n\\nExtract → Knit → Modify → Re-extract → Re-knit back to origin\\n\\nUser manages this flow explicitly; manifests provide context.\\n\\n\\n## Skills\\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\n### Available skills\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n### How to use skills\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\",\"truncation_policy\":{\"mode\":\"tokens\",\"limit\":10000}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:09:05.975Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"token_count\",\"info\":{\"total_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":148186,\"cached_input_tokens\":119424,\"output_tokens\":349,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":0,\"total_tokens\":148535},\"last_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":19123,\"cached_input_tokens\":18944,\"output_tokens\":75,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":0,\"total_tokens\":19198},\"model_context_window\":258400},\"rate_limits\":{\"primary\":{\"used_percent\":1.0,\"window_minutes\":300,\"resets_at\":1770498521},\"secondary\":{\"used_percent\":92.0,\"window_minutes\":10080,\"resets_at\":1770660258},\"credits\":{\"has_credits\":false,\"unlimited\":false,\"balance\":null},\"plan_type\":null}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:09:07.674Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"function_call\",\"name\":\"exec_command\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cmd\\\":\\\"sed

(file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n### How to use skills\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and

AGENTS.md\\n\\nLightweight collaboration rules for this repo.\\n\\n## Multi-Repo Context\\n\\nThese repos work together during tendrils development:\\n- **tendrils** (`/Users/l/Dev/tendrils`) - The extraction/transplantation tool\\n- **virdx-sandboxed** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sandboxed`) - Knit target AND extract source, original testbed\\n- **virdx-sketches** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches`) - Knit target for testing\\n- **virdx-site** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-site`) - Extract source ONLY, read-only, different Histology version\\n\\n## Core Philosophy\\n\\n1. **Ephemeral by design** - Manifests/snapshots are session-scoped decision aids, not persistent system-of-record. No drift detection, no staleness tracking.\\n\\n2. **80/20 wins** - Lightweight solutions providing 80% value at 20% complexity always preferred over \\\"complete\\\" solutions with 4x complexity for diminishing returns.\\n\\n3. **MVP first** - Ship working features before perfecting. We're extracting Histology, not building a universal platform.\\n\\n4. **Static determinability** - Only promise what can be statically determined. Context contracts ARE static; full composition graphs are runtime phenomena.\\n\\n5. **Iterative gap handling** - When testing reveals gaps, formalize as patterns not band-aids. Ask: \\\"What class of problem is this?\\\"\\n\\n6. **User manages context** - Tool provides metadata, user manages naming/organization.\\n\\n7. **Warn and continue** - Dirty state gets warning, doesn't block. Fits ephemeral philosophy.\\n\\n8. **Machine-first output** - JSON to stdout, logs to stderr. Feeds LLM agents, not humans scanning terminals.\\n\\n## Living Documents\\n\\n1. `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` are living documents.\\n2. Any changes in project structure, tooling, or philosophy must flow back into both files.\\n3. Prefer full rewrites over patch updates to prevent complexity creep.\\n\\n## README Freshness\\n\\n1. The README must always reflect the current state of the sandbox.\\n2. When updating the README, do a full rewrite instead of appending sections.\\n3. Remove information that is more than 7 days old unless it is still actively relevant.\\n\\n## Agent Workflow (OODA + Fail-Fast)\\n\\nAgent work follows an OODA-inspired loop with nested user feedback:\\n\\n1. **Observe**: Read code state, plans, prompts, existing artifacts.\\n\\n2. **Orient**: File exploration, MCP tool search, fan-out subagents for research. Critical user feedback discussion (may span multiple turns). Depending on outcome, may restart Observe/Orient.\\n\\n3. **Decide**: Synthesize findings, present plan with alternatives and choices for approval. Interview-style discussion with user. User may request further research. Final approval is user-gated before implementation.\\n\\n4. **Act**: Implementation proceeds only after user approval. Test-first, self-documenting code.\\n\\n## User Input Gates\\n\\nAlways ask the user when:\\n1. Aesthetic decisions arise (naming, structuring, code taste).\\n2. Non-obvious choices exist (architectures, patterns, libraries, tradeoffs between options).\\n\\n## Code Standards\\n\\n1. Test-first development\\n2. Prefer bun/uv ecosystems\\n3. All emojis banned in code, logs, docs (except semantic color circles)\\n4. Avoid over-engineering - only features needed for current use case\\n5. Write clear, self-documenting code\\n\\n## Agent Folders Policy\\n\\n**NEVER gitignore** the following directories - they contain project-specific agent steering, tooling, or skills that MUST be committed and move with the project:\\n\\n- `.claude/`\\n- `.codex/`\\n- `.gemini/`\\n- `.agent/`\\n- `.agents/`\\n\\nThese folders are first-class project artifacts, not ephemeral session data.\\n\\n## Repo Role\\n\\nThis repo serves as a fresh knit target for testing tendrils transplantation:\\n- Clean slate for testing extracted components\\n- Brand system integration testing\\n- Validation of knit workflow on minimal projects\\n\\n## Smart Upstreaming Flow\\n\\nExtract → Knit → Modify → Re-extract → Re-knit back to origin\\n\\nUser manages this flow explicitly; manifests provide context.\\n\\n\\n## Skills\\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\n### Available skills\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n### How to use skills\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and

No drift detection, no staleness tracking.\\n\\n2. **80/20 wins** - Lightweight solutions providing 80% value at 20% complexity always preferred over \\\"complete\\\" solutions with 4x complexity for diminishing returns.\\n\\n3. **MVP first** - Ship working features before perfecting. We're extracting Histology, not building a universal platform.\\n\\n4. **Static determinability** - Only promise what can be statically determined. Context contracts ARE static; full composition graphs are runtime phenomena.\\n\\n5. **Iterative gap handling** - When testing reveals gaps, formalize as patterns not band-aids. Ask: \\\"What class of problem is this?\\\"\\n\\n6. **User manages context** - Tool provides metadata, user manages naming/organization.\\n\\n7. **Warn and continue** - Dirty state gets warning, doesn't block. Fits ephemeral philosophy.\\n\\n8. **Machine-first output** - JSON to stdout, logs to stderr. Feeds LLM agents, not humans scanning terminals.\\n\\n## Living Documents\\n\\n1. `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` are living documents.\\n2.

Manifests/snapshots are session-scoped decision aids, not persistent system-of-record. No drift detection, no staleness tracking.\\n\\n2. **80/20 wins** - Lightweight solutions providing 80% value at 20% complexity always preferred over \\\"complete\\\" solutions with 4x complexity for diminishing returns.\\n\\n3. **MVP first** - Ship working features before perfecting. We're extracting Histology, not building a universal platform.\\n\\n4. **Static determinability** - Only promise what can be statically determined. Context contracts ARE static; full composition graphs are runtime phenomena.\\n\\n5. **Iterative gap handling** - When testing reveals gaps, formalize as patterns not band-aids. Ask: \\\"What class of problem is this?\\\"\\n\\n6. **User manages context** - Tool provides metadata, user manages naming/organization.\\n\\n7. **Warn and continue** - Dirty state gets warning, doesn't block.

Any changes in project structure, tooling, or philosophy must flow back into both files.\\n3. Prefer full rewrites over patch updates to prevent complexity creep.\\n\\n## README Freshness\\n\\n1. The README must always reflect the current state of the sandbox.\\n2. When updating the README, do a full rewrite instead of appending sections.\\n3. Remove information that is more than 7 days old unless it is still actively relevant.\\n\\n## Agent Workflow (OODA + Fail-Fast)\\n\\nAgent work follows an OODA-inspired loop with nested user feedback:\\n\\n1. **Observe**: Read code state, plans, prompts, existing artifacts.\\n\\n2. **Orient**: File exploration, MCP tool search, fan-out subagents for research. Critical user feedback discussion (may span multiple turns). Depending on outcome, may restart Observe/Orient.\\n\\n3. **Decide**: Synthesize findings, present plan with alternatives and choices for approval. Interview-style discussion with user. User may request further research. Final approval is user-gated before implementation.\\n\\n4. **Act**: Implementation proceeds only after user approval. Test-first, self-documenting code.\\n\\n## User Input Gates\\n\\nAlways ask the user when:\\n1. Aesthetic decisions arise (naming, structuring, code taste).\\n2. Non-obvious choices exist (architectures, patterns, libraries, tradeoffs between options).\\n\\n## Code Standards\\n\\n1. Test-first development\\n2. Prefer bun/uv ecosystems\\n3.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\n### Available skills\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n### How to use skills\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\",\"truncation_policy\":{\"mode\":\"tokens\",\"limit\":10000}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:14:58.387Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"token_count\",\"info\":{\"total_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":335292,\"cached_input_tokens\":287616,\"output_tokens\":1581,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":512,\"total_tokens\":336873},\"last_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":24837,\"cached_input_tokens\":17280,\"output_tokens\":260,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":192,\"total_tokens\":25097},\"model_context_window\":258400},\"rate_limits\":{\"primary\":{\"used_percent\":2.0,\"window_minutes\":300,\"resets_at\":1770498521},\"secondary\":{\"used_percent\":92.0,\"window_minutes\":10080,\"resets_at\":1770660258},\"credits\":{\"has_credits\":false,\"unlimited\":false,\"balance\":null},\"plan_type\":null}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:15:01.379Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"agent_reasoning\",\"text\":\"**Attempting

The extraction/transplantation tool\\n- **virdx-sandboxed** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sandboxed`) - Knit target AND extract source, original testbed\\n- **virdx-sketches** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches`) - Knit target for testing\\n- **virdx-site** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-site`) - Extract source ONLY, read-only, different Histology version\\n\\n## Core Philosophy\\n\\n1. **Ephemeral by design** - Manifests/snapshots are session-scoped decision aids, not persistent system-of-record. No drift detection, no staleness tracking.\\n\\n2. **80/20 wins** - Lightweight solutions providing 80% value at 20% complexity always preferred over \\\"complete\\\" solutions with 4x complexity for diminishing returns.\\n\\n3. **MVP first** - Ship working features before perfecting. We're extracting Histology, not building a universal platform.\\n\\n4. **Static determinability** - Only promise what can be statically determined. Context contracts ARE static; full composition graphs are runtime phenomena.\\n\\n5. **Iterative gap handling** - When testing reveals gaps, formalize as patterns not band-aids. Ask: \\\"What class of problem is this?\\\"\\n\\n6. **User manages context** - Tool provides metadata, user manages naming/organization.\\n\\n7. **Warn and continue** - Dirty state gets warning, doesn't block. Fits ephemeral philosophy.\\n\\n8. **Machine-first output** - JSON to stdout, logs to stderr. Feeds LLM agents, not humans scanning terminals.\\n\\n## Living Documents\\n\\n1. `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` are living documents.\\n2. Any changes in project structure, tooling, or philosophy must flow back into both files.\\n3. Prefer full rewrites over patch updates to prevent complexity creep.\\n\\n## README Freshness\\n\\n1. The README must always reflect the current state of the sandbox.\\n2. When updating the README, do a full rewrite instead of appending sections.\\n3. Remove information that is more than 7 days old unless it is still actively relevant.\\n\\n## Agent Workflow (OODA + Fail-Fast)\\n\\nAgent work follows an OODA-inspired loop with nested user feedback:\\n\\n1. **Observe**: Read code state, plans, prompts, existing artifacts.\\n\\n2. **Orient**: File exploration, MCP tool search, fan-out subagents for research. Critical user feedback discussion (may span multiple turns). Depending on outcome, may restart Observe/Orient.\\n\\n3. **Decide**: Synthesize findings, present plan with alternatives and choices for approval. Interview-style discussion with user. User may request further research. Final approval is user-gated before implementation.\\n\\n4. **Act**: Implementation proceeds only after user approval. Test-first, self-documenting code.\\n\\n## User Input Gates\\n\\nAlways ask the user when:\\n1. Aesthetic decisions arise (naming, structuring, code taste).\\n2. Non-obvious choices exist (architectures, patterns, libraries, tradeoffs between options).\\n\\n## Code Standards\\n\\n1. Test-first development\\n2. Prefer bun/uv ecosystems\\n3. All emojis banned in code, logs, docs (except semantic color circles)\\n4. Avoid over-engineering - only features needed for current use case\\n5. Write clear, self-documenting code\\n\\n## Agent Folders Policy\\n\\n**NEVER gitignore** the following directories - they contain project-specific agent steering, tooling, or skills that MUST be committed and move with the project:\\n\\n- `.claude/`\\n- `.codex/`\\n- `.gemini/`\\n- `.agent/`\\n- `.agents/`\\n\\nThese folders are first-class project artifacts, not ephemeral session data.\\n\\n## Repo Role\\n\\nThis repo serves as a fresh knit target for testing tendrils transplantation:\\n- Clean slate for testing extracted components\\n- Brand system integration testing\\n- Validation of knit workflow on minimal projects\\n\\n## Smart Upstreaming Flow\\n\\nExtract → Knit → Modify → Re-extract → Re-knit back to origin\\n\\nUser manages this flow explicitly; manifests provide context.\\n\\n\\n## Skills\\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\n### Available skills\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n### How to use skills\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

No drift detection, no staleness tracking.\\n\\n2. **80/20 wins** - Lightweight solutions providing 80% value at 20% complexity always preferred over \\\"complete\\\" solutions with 4x complexity for diminishing returns.\\n\\n3. **MVP first** - Ship working features before perfecting. We're extracting Histology, not building a universal platform.\\n\\n4. **Static determinability** - Only promise what can be statically determined. Context contracts ARE static; full composition graphs are runtime phenomena.\\n\\n5. **Iterative gap handling** - When testing reveals gaps, formalize as patterns not band-aids. Ask: \\\"What class of problem is this?\\\"\\n\\n6. **User manages context** - Tool provides metadata, user manages naming/organization.\\n\\n7. **Warn and continue** - Dirty state gets warning, doesn't block. Fits ephemeral philosophy.\\n\\n8. **Machine-first output** - JSON to stdout, logs to stderr. Feeds LLM agents, not humans scanning terminals.\\n\\n## Living Documents\\n\\n1. `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` are living documents.\\n2. Any changes in project structure, tooling, or philosophy must flow back into both files.\\n3. Prefer full rewrites over patch updates to prevent complexity creep.\\n\\n## README Freshness\\n\\n1. The README must always reflect the current state of the sandbox.\\n2. When updating the README, do a full rewrite instead of appending sections.\\n3. Remove information that is more than 7 days old unless it is still actively relevant.\\n\\n## Agent Workflow (OODA + Fail-Fast)\\n\\nAgent work follows an OODA-inspired loop with nested user feedback:\\n\\n1. **Observe**: Read code state, plans, prompts, existing artifacts.\\n\\n2. **Orient**: File exploration, MCP tool search, fan-out subagents for research. Critical user feedback discussion (may span multiple turns). Depending on outcome, may restart Observe/Orient.\\n\\n3. **Decide**: Synthesize findings, present plan with alternatives and choices for approval. Interview-style discussion with user. User may request further research. Final approval is user-gated before implementation.\\n\\n4. **Act**: Implementation proceeds only after user approval. Test-first, self-documenting code.\\n\\n## User Input Gates\\n\\nAlways ask the user when:\\n1. Aesthetic decisions arise (naming, structuring, code taste).\\n2. Non-obvious choices exist (architectures, patterns, libraries, tradeoffs between options).\\n\\n## Code Standards\\n\\n1. Test-first development\\n2. Prefer bun/uv ecosystems\\n3. All emojis banned in code, logs, docs (except semantic color circles)\\n4. Avoid over-engineering - only features needed for current use case\\n5. Write clear, self-documenting code\\n\\n## Agent Folders Policy\\n\\n**NEVER gitignore** the following directories - they contain project-specific agent steering, tooling, or skills that MUST be committed and move with the project:\\n\\n- `.claude/`\\n- `.codex/`\\n- `.gemini/`\\n- `.agent/`\\n- `.agents/`\\n\\nThese folders are first-class project artifacts, not ephemeral session data.\\n\\n## Repo Role\\n\\nThis repo serves as a fresh knit target for testing tendrils transplantation:\\n- Clean slate for testing extracted components\\n- Brand system integration testing\\n- Validation of knit workflow on minimal projects\\n\\n## Smart Upstreaming Flow\\n\\nExtract → Knit → Modify → Re-extract → Re-knit back to origin\\n\\nUser manages this flow explicitly; manifests provide context.\\n\\n\\n## Skills\\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\n### Available skills\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n### How to use skills\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all.

No drift detection, no staleness tracking.\\n\\n2. **80/20 wins** - Lightweight solutions providing 80% value at 20% complexity always preferred over \\\"complete\\\" solutions with 4x complexity for diminishing returns.\\n\\n3. **MVP first** - Ship working features before perfecting. We're extracting Histology, not building a universal platform.\\n\\n4. **Static determinability** - Only promise what can be statically determined. Context contracts ARE static; full composition graphs are runtime phenomena.\\n\\n5. **Iterative gap handling** - When testing reveals gaps, formalize as patterns not band-aids. Ask: \\\"What class of problem is this?\\\"\\n\\n6. **User manages context** - Tool provides metadata, user manages naming/organization.\\n\\n7. **Warn and continue** - Dirty state gets warning, doesn't block. Fits ephemeral philosophy.\\n\\n8. **Machine-first output** - JSON to stdout, logs to stderr. Feeds LLM agents, not humans scanning terminals.\\n\\n## Living Documents\\n\\n1. `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` are living documents.\\n2. Any changes in project structure, tooling, or philosophy must flow back into both files.\\n3. Prefer full rewrites over patch updates to prevent complexity creep.\\n\\n## README Freshness\\n\\n1. The README must always reflect the current state of the sandbox.\\n2. When updating the README, do a full rewrite instead of appending sections.\\n3. Remove information that is more than 7 days old unless it is still actively relevant.\\n\\n## Agent Workflow (OODA + Fail-Fast)\\n\\nAgent work follows an OODA-inspired loop with nested user feedback:\\n\\n1. **Observe**: Read code state, plans, prompts, existing artifacts.\\n\\n2. **Orient**: File exploration, MCP tool search, fan-out subagents for research. Critical user feedback discussion (may span multiple turns). Depending on outcome, may restart Observe/Orient.\\n\\n3. **Decide**: Synthesize findings, present plan with alternatives and choices for approval. Interview-style discussion with user. User may request further research. Final approval is user-gated before implementation.\\n\\n4. **Act**: Implementation proceeds only after user approval. Test-first, self-documenting code.\\n\\n## User Input Gates\\n\\nAlways ask the user when:\\n1. Aesthetic decisions arise (naming, structuring, code taste).\\n2. Non-obvious choices exist (architectures, patterns, libraries, tradeoffs between options).\\n\\n## Code Standards\\n\\n1. Test-first development\\n2. Prefer bun/uv ecosystems\\n3. All emojis banned in code, logs, docs (except semantic color circles)\\n4. Avoid over-engineering - only features needed for current use case\\n5. Write clear, self-documenting code\\n\\n## Agent Folders Policy\\n\\n**NEVER gitignore** the following directories - they contain project-specific agent steering, tooling, or skills that MUST be committed and move with the project:\\n\\n- `.claude/`\\n- `.codex/`\\n- `.gemini/`\\n- `.agent/`\\n- `.agents/`\\n\\nThese folders are first-class project artifacts, not ephemeral session data.\\n\\n## Repo Role\\n\\nThis repo serves as a fresh knit target for testing tendrils transplantation:\\n- Clean slate for testing extracted components\\n- Brand system integration testing\\n- Validation of knit workflow on minimal projects\\n\\n## Smart Upstreaming Flow\\n\\nExtract → Knit → Modify → Re-extract → Re-knit back to origin\\n\\nUser manages this flow explicitly; manifests provide context.\\n\\n\\n## Skills\\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\n### Available skills\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n### How to use skills\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

AGENTS.md\\n\\nLightweight collaboration rules for this repo.\\n\\n## Multi-Repo Context\\n\\nThese repos work together during tendrils development:\\n- **tendrils** (`/Users/l/Dev/tendrils`) - The extraction/transplantation tool\\n- **virdx-sandboxed** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sandboxed`) - Knit target AND extract source, original testbed\\n- **virdx-sketches** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches`) - Knit target for testing\\n- **virdx-site** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-site`) - Extract source ONLY, read-only, different Histology version\\n\\n## Core Philosophy\\n\\n1. **Ephemeral by design** - Manifests/snapshots are session-scoped decision aids, not persistent system-of-record. No drift detection, no staleness tracking.\\n\\n2. **80/20 wins** - Lightweight solutions providing 80% value at 20% complexity always preferred over \\\"complete\\\" solutions with 4x complexity for diminishing returns.\\n\\n3. **MVP first** - Ship working features before perfecting. We're extracting Histology, not building a universal platform.\\n\\n4. **Static determinability** - Only promise what can be statically determined. Context contracts ARE static; full composition graphs are runtime phenomena.\\n\\n5. **Iterative gap handling** - When testing reveals gaps, formalize as patterns not band-aids. Ask: \\\"What class of problem is this?\\\"\\n\\n6. **User manages context** - Tool provides metadata, user manages naming/organization.\\n\\n7. **Warn and continue** - Dirty state gets warning, doesn't block. Fits ephemeral philosophy.\\n\\n8. **Machine-first output** - JSON to stdout, logs to stderr. Feeds LLM agents, not humans scanning terminals.\\n\\n## Living Documents\\n\\n1. `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` are living documents.\\n2. Any changes in project structure, tooling, or philosophy must flow back into both files.\\n3. Prefer full rewrites over patch updates to prevent complexity creep.\\n\\n## README Freshness\\n\\n1. The README must always reflect the current state of the sandbox.\\n2. When updating the README, do a full rewrite instead of appending sections.\\n3. Remove information that is more than 7 days old unless it is still actively relevant.\\n\\n## Agent Workflow (OODA + Fail-Fast)\\n\\nAgent work follows an OODA-inspired loop with nested user feedback:\\n\\n1. **Observe**: Read code state, plans, prompts, existing artifacts.\\n\\n2. **Orient**: File exploration, MCP tool search, fan-out subagents for research. Critical user feedback discussion (may span multiple turns). Depending on outcome, may restart Observe/Orient.\\n\\n3. **Decide**: Synthesize findings, present plan with alternatives and choices for approval. Interview-style discussion with user. User may request further research. Final approval is user-gated before implementation.\\n\\n4. **Act**: Implementation proceeds only after user approval. Test-first, self-documenting code.\\n\\n## User Input Gates\\n\\nAlways ask the user when:\\n1. Aesthetic decisions arise (naming, structuring, code taste).\\n2. Non-obvious choices exist (architectures, patterns, libraries, tradeoffs between options).\\n\\n## Code Standards\\n\\n1. Test-first development\\n2. Prefer bun/uv ecosystems\\n3. All emojis banned in code, logs, docs (except semantic color circles)\\n4. Avoid over-engineering - only features needed for current use case\\n5. Write clear, self-documenting code\\n\\n## Agent Folders Policy\\n\\n**NEVER gitignore** the following directories - they contain project-specific agent steering, tooling, or skills that MUST be committed and move with the project:\\n\\n- `.claude/`\\n- `.codex/`\\n- `.gemini/`\\n- `.agent/`\\n- `.agents/`\\n\\nThese folders are first-class project artifacts, not ephemeral session data.\\n\\n## Repo Role\\n\\nThis repo serves as a fresh knit target for testing tendrils transplantation:\\n- Clean slate for testing extracted components\\n- Brand system integration testing\\n- Validation of knit workflow on minimal projects\\n\\n## Smart Upstreaming Flow\\n\\nExtract → Knit → Modify → Re-extract → Re-knit back to origin\\n\\nUser manages this flow explicitly; manifests provide context.\\n\\n\\n## Skills\\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\n### Available skills\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n### How to use skills\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\",\"truncation_policy\":{\"mode\":\"tokens\",\"limit\":10000}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:20:13.978Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"token_count\",\"info\":{\"total_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":520362,\"cached_input_tokens\":467200,\"output_tokens\":2964,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":1152,\"total_tokens\":523326},\"last_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":27531,\"cached_input_tokens\":27264,\"output_tokens\":80,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":0,\"total_tokens\":27611},\"model_context_window\":258400},\"rate_limits\":{\"primary\":{\"used_percent\":2.0,\"window_minutes\":300,\"resets_at\":1770498521},\"secondary\":{\"used_percent\":92.0,\"window_minutes\":10080,\"resets_at\":1770660258},\"credits\":{\"has_credits\":false,\"unlimited\":false,\"balance\":null},\"plan_type\":null}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:20:24.303Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"agent_reasoning\",\"text\":\"**Planning reconstruction of skills and brand files**\\n\\nThe skills folder and brand-named files are missing in the fresh SvelteKit setup, so I'll recreate the skills/bootstrap-styleguide folder with SKILL.md and assets including brand-template.md and brand-spec.schema.json.

Supports greenfield creation, brownfield completion, and migration of existing styles.\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n# Bootstrap Styleguide Skill\\\\n\\\\nThis skill bootstraps a comprehensive, \\\\\\\"Swiss-style\\\\\\\" brand guide and component destination in SvelteKit projects. It operates in three execution lanes depending on the project state.\\\\n\\\\n## Execution Lanes\\\\n\\\\n### Lane 1: Greenfield (Empty Directory)\\\\n**Trigger:** Directory is empty or near-empty (no `package.json`, no `svelte.config.js`).\\\\n\\\\n**Action:**\\\\n1.  **Scaffold Base Project:**\\\\n    Run the standard Virdx SvelteKit initialization:\\\\n    ```bash\\\\n    bun x sv create --template minimal --types ts --add tailwindcss=\\\\\\\"plugins:none\\\\\\\" mcp=\\\\\\\"ide:opencode+setup:remote\\\\\\\" --install bun .\\\\n    ```\\\\n    *(Note: Perform a dry-run first if necessary to ensure CLI behavior)*\\\\n\\\\n2.  **Proceed to Scaffolding Phase** (see below).\\\\n\\\\n### Lane 2: Brownfield (Partial/Incomplete)\\\\n**Trigger:** `package.json` exists but project appears incomplete (missing `src/routes`, `app.css`, or `tailwind.config.*`).\\\\n\\\\n**Action:**\\\\n1.  **Idempotent Check:**\\\\n    - Detect missing critical files (`tailwind.config.ts`, `src/app.css`, `src/routes/+layout.svelte`).\\\\n    - **Prompt User:** ask for permission to \\\\\\\"complete the scaffolding\\\\\\\" by creating missing files or re-running specific setup steps.\\\\n    - **Execute:** Fill in the gaps to reach a \\\\\\\"ready\\\\\\\" state for styleguide generation.\\\\n\\\\n2.  **Proceed to Scaffolding Phase.**\\\\n\\\\n### Lane 3: Migration (Existing Project)\\\\n**Trigger:** Valid SvelteKit project detected with existing styles (e.g., extensive `src/lib/components`, populated `app.css`).\\\\n\\\\n**Action:**\\\\n1.  **Scan & Offer:**\\\\n    - Detect that this is a populated project.\\\\n    - **Prompt User:**\\\\n        > \\\\\\\"I see an existing project. Do you want to scaffold the styleguide here, or migrate styles to a new location?\\\\\\\"\\\\n    - **Option A (Here):** Proceed to Scaffolding Phase in `src/routes/styleguide`.\\\\n    - **Option B (Migrate):** Ask for a target directory (inside or outside CWD). Scaffold a new Greenfiled project there (Lane 1), then help migrate content.\\\\n\\\\n2.  **Content Migration (If requested):**\\\\n    - Offer to scan `src/` for \\\\\\\"Candidate Files\\\\\\\" (colors, typography, logos).\\\\n    - Present a list of candidates to the user.\\\\n    - Ask for exclusions or additions.\\\\n    - Copy/Port selected assets to the new Styleguide's `src/lib/brand` or static assets.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## Scaffolding Phase (All Lanes)\\\\n\\\\nOnce the base project is ready, this phase generates the actual `/styleguide` route and brand spec.\\\\n\\\\n### 1. Scout\\\\n**Goal:** Analyze the codebase to infer brand primitives.\\\\n*   **Input:** `tailwind.config.*`, `src/app.css`, `src/routes/+layout.svelte`.\\\\n*   **Output:** A structured \\\\\\\"Scout Report\\\\\\\" (markdown) listing inferred:\\\\n    *   Colors (Primary, Accent, Neutral)\\\\n    *   Typography (Fonts, Weights, Scale)\\\\n    *   Shapes (Radius)\\\\n    *   Voice (if evident)\\\\n\\\\n### 2. Clarify (User-in-the-Loop)\\\\n**Goal:** Validate assumptions.\\\\n*   **Action:** Present the Scout Report. Ask 3-5 targeted questions.\\\\n    *   *Example:* \\\\\\\"Is #6366f1 your primary brand color?\\\\\\\"\\\\n    *   *Example:* \\\\\\\"Where is your logo file located?\\\\\\\"\\\\n*   **Rule:** User input is authoritative.\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Generate Artifacts\\\\n**Goal:** Write the styleguide files.\\\\n*   **Reference:** Use `assets/brand-spec.schema.json` as the strict schema.\\\\n*   **Reference:** Use `assets/BRAND_TEMPLATE.md` as the content structure guide.\\\\n\\\\n**Files to Generate:**\\\\n1.  `src/lib/brand/brand.generated.json` (The Data):\\\\n    *   Populated with clarified data.\\\\n    *   Follows strict schema.\\\\n2.  `src/routes/styleguide/+layout.svelte` (The Frame):\\\\n    *   **Isolated Layout:** Do NOT import app chrome (nav/footer).\\\\n    *   **Style:** Clean, neutral canvas.\\\\n3.  `src/routes/styleguide/+page.svelte` (The Guide):\\\\n    *   **Visuals:** Swiss-style presentation (Grid-based, ample whitespace).\\\\n    *   **Sections:** Header, Logo, Colors, Typography, Patterns, Voice, Resources.\\\\n    *   **Implementation:** Read `brand.generated.json` and render it.\\\\n    *   **Tech:** Svelte 5 Runes syntax.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## Assets\\\\n*   `assets/brand-spec.schema.json`: JSON Schema for the brand data model.\\\\n*   `assets/BRAND_TEMPLATE.md`: Markdown template for brand content.\\\\nEOF\\\"}\",\"call_id\":\"call_PSM76t6tJin7FXiACACyucbw\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:20:43.550Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"token_count\",\"info\":{\"total_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":576415,\"cached_input_tokens\":522880,\"output_tokens\":4735,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":1664,\"total_tokens\":581150},\"last_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":28331,\"cached_input_tokens\":28160,\"output_tokens\":1204,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":0,\"total_tokens\":29535},\"model_context_window\":258400},\"rate_limits\":{\"primary\":{\"used_percent\":2.0,\"window_minutes\":300,\"resets_at\":1770498521},\"secondary\":{\"used_percent\":92.0,\"window_minutes\":10080,\"resets_at\":1770660258},\"credits\":{\"has_credits\":false,\"unlimited\":false,\"balance\":null},\"plan_type\":null}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:20:43.639Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"function_call_output\",\"call_id\":\"call_PSM76t6tJin7FXiACACyucbw\",\"output\":\"Chunk ID: 7006da\\nWall time: 0.0521 seconds\\nProcess exited with code 0\\nOriginal token count: 0\\nOutput:\\n\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:20:43.639Z\",\"type\":\"turn_context\",\"payload\":{\"cwd\":\"/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches\",\"approval_policy\":\"never\",\"sandbox_policy\":{\"type\":\"danger-full-access\"},\"model\":\"gpt-5.2-codex\",\"personality\":\"pragmatic\",\"collaboration_mode\":{\"mode\":\"default\",\"settings\":{\"model\":\"gpt-5.2-codex\",\"reasoning_effort\":\"medium\",\"developer_instructions\":null}},\"effort\":\"medium\",\"summary\":\"auto\",\"user_instructions\":\"# AGENTS.md\\n\\nLightweight collaboration rules for this repo.\\n\\n## Multi-Repo Context\\n\\nThese repos work together during tendrils development:\\n- **tendrils** (`/Users/l/Dev/tendrils`) - The extraction/transplantation tool\\n- **virdx-sandboxed** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sandboxed`) - Knit target AND extract source, original testbed\\n- **virdx-sketches** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches`) - Knit target for testing\\n- **virdx-site** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-site`) - Extract source ONLY, read-only, different Histology version\\n\\n## Core Philosophy\\n\\n1. **Ephemeral by design** - Manifests/snapshots are session-scoped decision aids, not persistent system-of-record.

If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and

AGENTS.md\\n\\nLightweight collaboration rules for this repo.\\n\\n## Multi-Repo Context\\n\\nThese repos work together during tendrils development:\\n- **tendrils** (`/Users/l/Dev/tendrils`) - The extraction/transplantation tool\\n- **virdx-sandboxed** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sandboxed`) - Knit target AND extract source, original testbed\\n- **virdx-sketches** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches`) - Knit target for testing\\n- **virdx-site** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-site`) - Extract source ONLY, read-only, different Histology version\\n\\n## Core Philosophy\\n\\n1. **Ephemeral by design** - Manifests/snapshots are session-scoped decision aids, not persistent system-of-record. No drift detection, no staleness tracking.\\n\\n2. **80/20 wins** - Lightweight solutions providing 80% value at 20% complexity always preferred over \\\"complete\\\" solutions with 4x complexity for diminishing returns.\\n\\n3. **MVP first** - Ship working features before perfecting. We're extracting Histology, not building a universal platform.\\n\\n4. **Static determinability** - Only promise what can be statically determined. Context contracts ARE static; full composition graphs are runtime phenomena.\\n\\n5. **Iterative gap handling** - When testing reveals gaps, formalize as patterns not band-aids. Ask: \\\"What class of problem is this?\\\"\\n\\n6. **User manages context** - Tool provides metadata, user manages naming/organization.\\n\\n7. **Warn and continue** - Dirty state gets warning, doesn't block. Fits ephemeral philosophy.\\n\\n8. **Machine-first output** - JSON to stdout, logs to stderr. Feeds LLM agents, not humans scanning terminals.\\n\\n## Living Documents\\n\\n1. `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` are living documents.\\n2. Any changes in project structure, tooling, or philosophy must flow back into both files.\\n3. Prefer full rewrites over patch updates to prevent complexity creep.\\n\\n## README Freshness\\n\\n1. The README must always reflect the current state of the sandbox.\\n2. When updating the README, do a full rewrite instead of appending sections.\\n3. Remove information that is more than 7 days old unless it is still actively relevant.\\n\\n## Agent Workflow (OODA + Fail-Fast)\\n\\nAgent work follows an OODA-inspired loop with nested user feedback:\\n\\n1. **Observe**: Read code state, plans, prompts, existing artifacts.\\n\\n2. **Orient**: File exploration, MCP tool search, fan-out subagents for research. Critical user feedback discussion (may span multiple turns). Depending on outcome, may restart Observe/Orient.\\n\\n3. **Decide**: Synthesize findings, present plan with alternatives and choices for approval. Interview-style discussion with user. User may request further research. Final approval is user-gated before implementation.\\n\\n4. **Act**: Implementation proceeds only after user approval. Test-first, self-documenting code.\\n\\n## User Input Gates\\n\\nAlways ask the user when:\\n1. Aesthetic decisions arise (naming, structuring, code taste).\\n2. Non-obvious choices exist (architectures, patterns, libraries, tradeoffs between options).\\n\\n## Code Standards\\n\\n1. Test-first development\\n2. Prefer bun/uv ecosystems\\n3. All emojis banned in code, logs, docs (except semantic color circles)\\n4. Avoid over-engineering - only features needed for current use case\\n5. Write clear, self-documenting code\\n\\n## Agent Folders Policy\\n\\n**NEVER gitignore** the following directories - they contain project-specific agent steering, tooling, or skills that MUST be committed and move with the project:\\n\\n- `.claude/`\\n- `.codex/`\\n- `.gemini/`\\n- `.agent/`\\n- `.agents/`\\n\\nThese folders are first-class project artifacts, not ephemeral session data.\\n\\n## Repo Role\\n\\nThis repo serves as a fresh knit target for testing tendrils transplantation:\\n- Clean slate for testing extracted components\\n- Brand system integration testing\\n- Validation of knit workflow on minimal projects\\n\\n## Smart Upstreaming Flow\\n\\nExtract → Knit → Modify → Re-extract → Re-knit back to origin\\n\\nUser manages this flow explicitly; manifests provide context.\\n\\n\\n## Skills\\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\n### Available skills\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n### How to use skills\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\",\"truncation_policy\":{\"mode\":\"tokens\",\"limit\":10000}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:21:52.020Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"token_count\",\"info\":{\"total_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":668582,\"cached_input_tokens\":599552,\"output_tokens\":8982,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":1920,\"total_tokens\":677564},\"last_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":31549,\"cached_input_tokens\":30208,\"output_tokens\":2359,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":256,\"total_tokens\":33908},\"model_context_window\":258400},\"rate_limits\":{\"primary\":{\"used_percent\":3.0,\"window_minutes\":300,\"resets_at\":1770498522},\"secondary\":{\"used_percent\":92.0,\"window_minutes\":10080,\"resets_at\":1770660259},\"credits\":{\"has_credits\":false,\"unlimited\":false,\"balance\":null},\"plan_type\":null}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:21:55.100Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"agent_reasoning\",\"text\":\"**Confirming restored files and scope**\\n\\nI'll restore only the skills and brand-related files the user requested, noting template and schema files were reconstructed and may differ, and ask them to verify or provide originals if needed.

No drift detection, no staleness tracking.\\n\\n2. **80/20 wins** - Lightweight solutions providing 80% value at 20% complexity always preferred over \\\"complete\\\" solutions with 4x complexity for diminishing returns.\\n\\n3. **MVP first** - Ship working features before perfecting. We're extracting Histology, not building a universal platform.\\n\\n4. **Static determinability** - Only promise what can be statically determined. Context contracts ARE static; full composition graphs are runtime phenomena.\\n\\n5. **Iterative gap handling** - When testing reveals gaps, formalize as patterns not band-aids. Ask: \\\"What class of problem is this?\\\"\\n\\n6. **User manages context** - Tool provides metadata, user manages naming/organization.\\n\\n7. **Warn and continue** - Dirty state gets warning, doesn't block. Fits ephemeral philosophy.\\n\\n8. **Machine-first output** - JSON to stdout, logs to stderr. Feeds LLM agents, not humans scanning terminals.\\n\\n## Living Documents\\n\\n1. `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` are living documents.\\n2. Any changes in project structure, tooling, or philosophy must flow back into both files.\\n3. Prefer full rewrites over patch updates to prevent complexity creep.\\n\\n## README Freshness\\n\\n1. The README must always reflect the current state of the sandbox.\\n2. When updating the README, do a full rewrite instead of appending sections.\\n3. Remove information that is more than 7 days old unless it is still actively relevant.\\n\\n## Agent Workflow (OODA + Fail-Fast)\\n\\nAgent work follows an OODA-inspired loop with nested user feedback:\\n\\n1. **Observe**: Read code state, plans, prompts, existing artifacts.\\n\\n2. **Orient**: File exploration, MCP tool search, fan-out subagents for research. Critical user feedback discussion (may span multiple turns). Depending on outcome, may restart Observe/Orient.\\n\\n3. **Decide**: Synthesize findings, present plan with alternatives and choices for approval. Interview-style discussion with user. User may request further research. Final approval is user-gated before implementation.\\n\\n4. **Act**: Implementation proceeds only after user approval. Test-first, self-documenting code.\\n\\n## User Input Gates\\n\\nAlways ask the user when:\\n1. Aesthetic decisions arise (naming, structuring, code taste).\\n2. Non-obvious choices exist (architectures, patterns, libraries, tradeoffs between options).\\n\\n## Code Standards\\n\\n1. Test-first development\\n2. Prefer bun/uv ecosystems\\n3. All emojis banned in code, logs, docs (except semantic color circles)\\n4. Avoid over-engineering - only features needed for current use case\\n5. Write clear, self-documenting code\\n\\n## Agent Folders Policy\\n\\n**NEVER gitignore** the following directories - they contain project-specific agent steering, tooling, or skills that MUST be committed and move with the project:\\n\\n- `.claude/`\\n- `.codex/`\\n- `.gemini/`\\n- `.agent/`\\n- `.agents/`\\n\\nThese folders are first-class project artifacts, not ephemeral session data.\\n\\n## Repo Role\\n\\nThis repo serves as a fresh knit target for testing tendrils transplantation:\\n- Clean slate for testing extracted components\\n- Brand system integration testing\\n- Validation of knit workflow on minimal projects\\n\\n## Smart Upstreaming Flow\\n\\nExtract → Knit → Modify → Re-extract → Re-knit back to origin\\n\\nUser manages this flow explicitly; manifests provide context.\\n\\n\\n## Skills\\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\n### Available skills\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n### How to use skills\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\\\n### Available skills\\\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\\\n### How to use skills\\\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\\\n- Context hygiene:\\\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\\\\nEOF\\\"}\",\"call_id\":\"call_6kplHKrmVFCicMpsm9R46kST\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:25:44.540Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"token_count\",\"info\":{\"total_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":908454,\"cached_input_tokens\":826112,\"output_tokens\":11292,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":1984,\"total_tokens\":919746},\"last_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":35435,\"cached_input_tokens\":33152,\"output_tokens\":1671,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":0,\"total_tokens\":37106},\"model_context_window\":258400},\"rate_limits\":{\"primary\":{\"used_percent\":3.0,\"window_minutes\":300,\"resets_at\":1770498521},\"secondary\":{\"used_percent\":92.0,\"window_minutes\":10080,\"resets_at\":1770660258},\"credits\":{\"has_credits\":false,\"unlimited\":false,\"balance\":null},\"plan_type\":null}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:25:44.629Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"function_call_output\",\"call_id\":\"call_6kplHKrmVFCicMpsm9R46kST\",\"output\":\"Chunk ID: 62197d\\nWall time: 0.0520 seconds\\nProcess exited with code 0\\nOriginal token count: 0\\nOutput:\\n\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:25:44.629Z\",\"type\":\"turn_context\",\"payload\":{\"cwd\":\"/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches\",\"approval_policy\":\"never\",\"sandbox_policy\":{\"type\":\"danger-full-access\"},\"model\":\"gpt-5.2-codex\",\"personality\":\"pragmatic\",\"collaboration_mode\":{\"mode\":\"default\",\"settings\":{\"model\":\"gpt-5.2-codex\",\"reasoning_effort\":\"medium\",\"developer_instructions\":null}},\"effort\":\"medium\",\"summary\":\"auto\",\"user_instructions\":\"# AGENTS.md\\n\\nLightweight collaboration rules for this repo.\\n\\n## Multi-Repo Context\\n\\nThese repos work together during tendrils development:\\n- **tendrils** (`/Users/l/Dev/tendrils`) - The extraction/transplantation tool\\n- **virdx-sandboxed** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sandboxed`) - Knit target AND extract source, original testbed\\n- **virdx-sketches** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches`) - Knit target for testing\\n- **virdx-site** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-site`) - Extract source ONLY, read-only, different Histology version\\n\\n## Core Philosophy\\n\\n1. **Ephemeral by design** - Manifests/snapshots are session-scoped decision aids, not persistent system-of-record.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\n### Available skills\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n### How to use skills\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\",\"truncation_policy\":{\"mode\":\"tokens\",\"limit\":10000}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:27:47.439Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"token_count\",\"info\":{\"total_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":982771,\"cached_input_tokens\":896768,\"output_tokens\":11507,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":1984,\"total_tokens\":994278},\"last_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":37169,\"cached_input_tokens\":35328,\"output_tokens\":172,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":0,\"total_tokens\":37341},\"model_context_window\":258400},\"rate_limits\":{\"primary\":{\"used_percent\":3.0,\"window_minutes\":300,\"resets_at\":1770498521},\"secondary\":{\"used_percent\":92.0,\"window_minutes\":10080,\"resets_at\":1770660258},\"credits\":{\"has_credits\":false,\"unlimited\":false,\"balance\":null},\"plan_type\":null}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:27:54.342Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"function_call\",\"name\":\"exec_command\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cmd\\\":\\\"cat > CONTEXT_FOR_NEXT_SESSION.md <<'EOF'\\\\n# Context for Next Session: Styleguide Skill Development\\\\n\\\\n**Current State:**\\\\n*   The `bootstrap-styleguide` skill definition has been consolidated into `skills/bootstrap-styleguide/`.\\\\n*   The old spec files (`design.md`, `styleguide-skill.md`) have been deleted to remove ambiguity.\\\\n*   The current directory (`virdx-sketches`) is in a **Brownfield** state (Lane 2):\\\\n    *   It has some SvelteKit scaffolding (vite, svelte.config).\\\\n    *   It has `src/lib/brand/` content already.\\\\n    *   It is missing a full `tailwind.config` or might need verification of its setup.\\\\n\\\\n**Immediate Task:**\\\\nStart developing the actual *implementation* of the skill defined in `skills/bootstrap-styleguide/SKILL.md`.\\\\n\\\\n**Workflow:**\\\\n1.  **Read the Skill:** Start by reading `skills/bootstrap-styleguide/SKILL.md` to understand the 3 Lanes.\\\\n2.  **Test Lane 2 (Brownfield):** Since we are in `virdx-sketches`, test the \\\\\\\"Brownfield\\\\\\\" logic.\\\\n    *   Check what's missing.\\\\n    *   \\\\\\\"Complete the scaffold\\\\\\\" idempotently.\\\\n3.  **Implement Scaffolding Phase:**\\\\n    *   Write the code/prompts to generate `brand.generated.json` and the `/styleguide` route.\\\\n    *   Use the assets in `skills/bootstrap-styleguide/assets/` as source material.\\\\n\\\\n**Reminders:**\\\\n*   The user wants to \\\\\\\"clear context\\\\\\\" after this setup.

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos).

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn.

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\",\"truncation_policy\":{\"mode\":\"tokens\",\"limit\":10000}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:28:16.315Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"token_count\",\"info\":{\"total_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":1057952,\"cached_input_tokens\":971264,\"output_tokens\":11987,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":1984,\"total_tokens\":1069939},\"last_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":37827,\"cached_input_tokens\":37248,\"output_tokens\":49,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":0,\"total_tokens\":37876},\"model_context_window\":258400},\"rate_limits\":{\"primary\":{\"used_percent\":3.0,\"window_minutes\":300,\"resets_at\":1770498521},\"secondary\":{\"used_percent\":92.0,\"window_minutes\":10080,\"resets_at\":1770660258},\"credits\":{\"has_credits\":false,\"unlimited\":false,\"balance\":null},\"plan_type\":null}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:28:19.686Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"agent_reasoning\",\"text\":\"**Updating context file with greenfield rewrite**\\n\\nI'm rewriting the README/AGENTS context file from scratch using direct file overwrite and noting restored assets, skipping patch application and planning steps.\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:28:19.686Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"reasoning\",\"summary\":[{\"type\":\"summary_text\",\"text\":\"**Updating context file with greenfield rewrite**\\n\\nI'm rewriting the README/AGENTS context file from scratch using direct file overwrite and noting restored assets, skipping patch application and planning steps.\"}],\"content\":null,\"encrypted_content\":\"gAAAAABph2gj9yPykq8G_aH3nWPjWYMOUMLTbxPbN-fpkNj-EYz9Ary8fODqwBACEcS4JMKkY-GYIdoNVZkOv6E7Q3w_KE54oC-p5ugra_2I9oqCnYIJw6zx7J02QBPCU4aCrhE_QTpw340HoZrMmQ965eCKmerFT9ziKDoqTcIH_9f5ufQhlNxMiyE5klNlC51T9maF0VSkgUkmNYcvTM5wbvPBCYy6bS7OVo74kG19mjFLUx6NWThKWqmsgqhRmiLAc7nThNjLRVaoSXhsP-jWzF2hgRRbK8eZ1qoB-hwpW-Lz1E3TLlP9XBYpQ5uN7rDcjbmqXzxwU39jddq-qOMFnGXQuNon52Eql0H9oiuYpUQvXSjilZ5PYbNOxpstoH_yg4YjmKayDIaguBgAYqLnZ8SnccOXVClZB34VZYAG8TGzWkPxOsPXZN6baoxBEfBeSCDc0vgpXNja3spz0z4-5oYWC0GRxrWW3WAY51k_ZgfKIf2gVCJce8FYZV9kMQa5q3nUcsVJO1DJ8bn0C-f48w5T56UBaSCrkBHBvsDs4QsTZvSc-MCHBVAmQ13mlUgaZTnb0xSk1VJj5HkqcdvAieoQTvju2Jt_2gK1z0GN7Zv9uTGLgOUxrb_A5FBPFdLHtueKqgTbIHyu2H3uwG8YtsbGnjnLAPEmQXX4ocg2iNBwaciH6ucLXosPZ0gzc-jKYGlAloYtcW6oeosOrUDOBqLyc_lImzXiL1h4nsUGB1yTWPshRhS0NX539dk-v4dJNUZGQYnjz_xV2vdiJLctEu3aQBkNOYshCRm5he5KGTbi4Wiohex8sKYEM7m5Al0VGW23s1pXdhW2fuTvfusvk9NATxaQ-hZu4P0qBYp-SmAGUjZVLuKsrQ78tfL99LBOeMISEwh3CVBBbhf4SDsVK4V2gE84OseolWLpd7wD1M2deDG_cSO7o7Zw39WCyDTCHsKmKmvP6gJC7C1SeQBLrYWU-q0b_QEdQg2fCj4L8EGDPH2ZdlI3vsN-SCSHMio8K144q9B5gIlOjn4rT-A0IuFRnqugxtL5UfZ-tMT3x6B3B5CuT_USpTDUMdV9cfLzxVfL0kLSFxFZSwyCh8hBFEweKxrZPT5WEH_6VsIZkyThh_JBxJsTLJvyh-fa7L30byrFDmBm\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:28:23.535Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"function_call\",\"name\":\"exec_command\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cmd\\\":\\\"cat > CONTEXT_FOR_NEXT_SESSION.md <<'EOF'\\\\n# Context for Next Session: Styleguide Skill Development\\\\n\\\\n**Current State:**\\\\n*   Repo was reset to a fresh **Greenfield** SvelteKit scaffold using the Lane 1 command.\\\\n*   The `bootstrap-styleguide` skill definition has been restored into `skills/bootstrap-styleguide/`.\\\\n*   The skill assets were restored:\\\\n    *   `skills/bootstrap-styleguide/assets/brand-spec.schema.json`\\\\n    *   `skills/bootstrap-styleguide/assets/BRAND_TEMPLATE.md`\\\\n*   Brand data model restored to `src/lib/brand/brand-spec.ts`.\\\\n*   `AGENTS.md` was recreated.\\\\n\\\\n**Immediate Task:**\\\\nStart developing the actual *implementation* of the skill defined in `skills/bootstrap-styleguide/SKILL.md`.\\\\n\\\\n**Workflow:**\\\\n1.  **Read the Skill:** Start by reading `skills/bootstrap-styleguide/SKILL.md` to understand the 3 Lanes.\\\\n2.  **Confirm Lane 1:** This repo is now a clean scaffold.\\\\n3.  **Implement Scaffolding Phase:**\\\\n    *   Write the code/prompts to generate `src/lib/brand/brand.generated.json` and the `/styleguide` route.\\\\n    *   Use the assets in `skills/bootstrap-styleguide/assets/` as source material.\\\\n\\\\n**Reminders:**\\\\n*   The user wants to \\\\\\\"clear context\\\\\\\" after this setup.

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\",\"truncation_policy\":{\"mode\":\"tokens\",\"limit\":10000}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:29:02.407Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"token_count\",\"info\":{\"total_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":1134206,\"cached_input_tokens\":1046784,\"output_tokens\":12518,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":1984,\"total_tokens\":1146724},\"last_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":38369,\"cached_input_tokens\":37760,\"output_tokens\":90,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":0,\"total_tokens\":38459},\"model_context_window\":258400},\"rate_limits\":{\"primary\":{\"used_percent\":3.0,\"window_minutes\":300,\"resets_at\":1770498521},\"secondary\":{\"used_percent\":92.0,\"window_minutes\":10080,\"resets_at\":1770660258},\"credits\":{\"has_credits\":false,\"unlimited\":false,\"balance\":null},\"plan_type\":null}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:29:04.311Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"agent_reasoning\",\"text\":\"**Starting code exploration**\\n\\nI'm preparing to check the Tailwind config, app.css, and layout files to understand styling and layout setup before planning next steps.\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:29:04.311Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"reasoning\",\"summary\":[{\"type\":\"summary_text\",\"text\":\"**Starting code exploration**\\n\\nI'm preparing to check the Tailwind config, app.css, and layout files to understand styling and layout setup before planning next steps.\"}],\"content\":null,\"encrypted_content\":\"gAAAAABph2hQ_VMe1YQ3DhAgvEhsqB3NkrmoxoP_mVMUUo1qN3StOCPxM7QXpHAOGHCS3vrH_Qi4YmxaZi4DRZNRIjAT78JZoJHZfyeoJc2DmJ4L5RVdXPzBi7fjJzPmDLFkgyh3z_gAnEvSEOZSVH9_wy6gwuCMrzBW0sW8o1VwC454iUkHtSCFL1toyJYZE6N59AkqSOvNbY9pR1FRpnRI6av_ovKLdne_gamDMxsrZIN9gBEsZs5sMohhmwsUczNV9Hngx7FapZZsT4zn-B5FP9Xd8ipyzQIMjZCCePuqQ7Y9Be6b5kzFXJELO8Se5UtxaAzAppvXDQkIVuO5SnQgenCmHDqjkcBCMHEctaXxWIUJ45zJVXkLGierDAOd-voczrvJVyxdd-Hqhk3lsU9-bbaAsahL6Vq-n0OQeSHClJuaWZIshPI2TC367rD_5xAU3KZ4cpMgrw5PVmP52wtyc4nxz-WF_3P-1gphOGSwMIO90X1hCtqT3zv9Ah_SQDf1Zkq311uIqLMxTijhN2SYS06diJrDt7WD__Bwlis7zVnozEl88jo-HrUFX9BMX8SOBkQ2vTBy8gbRYCxp1FAmGDmEXpfZyYp1VNXyd8p8MXtfaDC0yKt9kGWWm1NqmvTwSglAsjYaFQUHyXJ97KyiPYLxAYEcTzOrc1jOYlWKpKcZbiC3E4ZWwJjOuUfFD_Tl3Kdn3rYv_lKbiOjwzdfGSNTT1zF_YAdDYTTSapp1hLLrybVcDjsShhRBNUI7f9ZrUlSIAjO5CISzhefHQMCoPmMcBIXb6h0a6YttJG7ueGz-WdqSYJo6PChkcCEL33rSUoYnHUTdXkTDo4whNf8JFyROUk-qrly2G1MFKCr5SxqD5yFHStHsgOCKBslp7qY5VEVTTr8Itco6L7nAOOHB6iPgIvaqK5i_aXlDMXZZHbtiquE1fgm8a52ZSucrOFrYyaDOg5sjpeZhJ_T2Wjb0tmviY95Jdg==\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:29:04.594Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"function_call\",\"name\":\"exec_command\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cmd\\\":\\\"rg --files -g 'tailwind.config.*' -g 'src/app.css' -g 'src/routes/+layout.svelte'\\\"}\",\"call_id\":\"call_vsQoDSZxs8qZXmKDuoLCNEA5\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:29:04.606Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"token_count\",\"info\":{\"total_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":1172619,\"cached_input_tokens\":1084544,\"output_tokens\":12597,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":1984,\"total_tokens\":1185216},\"last_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":38413,\"cached_input_tokens\":37760,\"output_tokens\":79,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":0,\"total_tokens\":38492},\"model_context_window\":258400},\"rate_limits\":{\"primary\":{\"used_percent\":3.0,\"window_minutes\":300,\"resets_at\":1770498521},\"secondary\":{\"used_percent\":92.0,\"window_minutes\":10080,\"resets_at\":1770660258},\"credits\":{\"has_credits\":false,\"unlimited\":false,\"balance\":null},\"plan_type\":null}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:29:04.699Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"function_call_output\",\"call_id\":\"call_vsQoDSZxs8qZXmKDuoLCNEA5\",\"output\":\"Chunk ID: aafd21\\nWall time: 0.0523 seconds\\nProcess exited with code 0\\nOriginal token count: 7\\nOutput:\\nsrc/routes/+layout.svelte\\n\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:29:04.699Z\",\"type\":\"turn_context\",\"payload\":{\"cwd\":\"/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches\",\"approval_policy\":\"never\",\"sandbox_policy\":{\"type\":\"danger-full-access\"},\"model\":\"gpt-5.2-codex\",\"personality\":\"pragmatic\",\"collaboration_mode\":{\"mode\":\"default\",\"settings\":{\"model\":\"gpt-5.2-codex\",\"reasoning_effort\":\"medium\",\"developer_instructions\":null}},\"effort\":\"medium\",\"summary\":\"auto\",\"user_instructions\":\"# AGENTS.md\\n\\nLightweight collaboration rules for this repo.\\n\\n## Multi-Repo Context\\n\\nThese repos work together during tendrils development:\\n- **tendrils** (`/Users/l/Dev/tendrils`) -

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\n### Available skills\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n### How to use skills\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\",\"truncation_policy\":{\"mode\":\"tokens\",\"limit\":10000}}}\nError: (none)\nExit Code: 0\nSignal: 0\nBackground PIDs: (none)\nProcess Group PGID: 82876"

You and the user share the same workspace and collaborate to achieve the user's goals.\\n\\n# Personality\\nYou are a deeply pragmatic, effective software engineer. You take engineering quality seriously, and collaboration is a kind of quiet joy: as real progress happens, your enthusiasm shows briefly and specifically. You communicate efficiently, keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail.\\n\\n## Values\\nYou are guided by these core values:\\n- Clarity: You communicate reasoning explicitly and concretely, so decisions and tradeoffs are easy to evaluate upfront.\\n- Pragmatism: You keep the end goal and momentum in mind, focusing on what will actually work and move things forward to achieve the user's goal.\\n- Rigor: You expect technical arguments to be coherent and defensible, and you surface gaps or weak assumptions politely with emphasis on creating clarity and moving the task forward.\\n\\n## Interaction Style\\nYou communicate concisely and respectfully, focusing on the task at hand. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\\n\\nGreat work and smart decisions are acknowledged, while avoiding cheerleading, motivational language, or artificial reassurance. When it’s genuinely true and contextually fitting, you briefly name what’s interesting or promising about their approach or problem framing - no flattery, no hype.\\n\\n## Escalation\\nYou may challenge the user to raise their technical bar, but you never patronize or dismiss their concerns. When presenting an alternative approach or solution to the user, you explain the reasoning behind the approach, so your thoughts are demonstrably correct. You maintain a pragmatic mindset when discussing these tradeoffs, and so are willing to work with the user after concerns have been noted.\\n\\n\\n# Working with the user\\n\\nYou interact with the user through a terminal. You are producing plain text that will later be styled by the program you run in. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value. Follow the formatting rules exactly. \\n\\n## Final answer formatting rules\\n- You may format with GitHub-flavored Markdown.\\n- Structure your answer if necessary, the complexity of the answer should match the task. If the task is simple, your answer should be a one-liner. Order sections from general to specific to supporting.\\n- Never use nested bullets. Keep lists flat (single level). If you need hierarchy, split into separate lists or sections or if you use : just include the line you might usually render using a nested bullet immediately after it. For numbered lists, only use the `1. 2. 3.` style markers (with a period), never `1)`.\\n- Headers are optional, only use them when you think they are necessary. If you do use them, use short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**. Don't add a blank line.\\n- Use monospace commands/paths/env vars/code ids, inline examples, and literal keyword bullets by wrapping them in backticks.\\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks. Include an info string as often as possible.\\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\\n  * Do not provide range of lines\\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\\\repo\\\\project\\\\main.rs:12:5\\n- Don’t use emojis.\\n\\n\\n## Presenting your work\\n- Balance conciseness to not overwhelm the user with appropriate detail for the request. Do not narrate abstractly; explain what you are doing and why.\\n- The user does not see command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\\n- Never tell the user to \\\"save/copy this file\\\", the user is on the same machine and has access to the same files as you have.\\n- If the user asks for a code explanation, structure your answer with code references.\\n- When given a simple task, just provide the outcome in a short answer without strong formatting.\\n- When you make big or complex changes, state the solution first, then walk the user through what you did and why.\\n- For casual chit-chat, just chat.\\n- If you weren't able to do something, for example run tests, tell the user.\\n- If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps. When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\\n\\n# General\\n\\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\\n\\n## Editing constraints\\n\\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \\\"Assigns the value to the variable\\\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\\n- You struggle using the git interactive console. **ALWAYS** prefer using non-interactive git commands.\\n\\n## Plan tool\\n\\nWhen using the planning tool:\\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\\n- Do not make single-step plans.\\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\\n\\n## Special user requests\\n\\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\\n- When the user asks for a review, you default to a code-review mindset. Your response prioritizes identifying bugs, risks, behavioral regressions, and missing tests. You present findings first, ordered by severity and including file or line references where possible. Open questions or assumptions follow. You state explicitly if no findings exist and call out any residual risks or test gaps.\\n\\n## Frontend tasks\\n\\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \\\"AI slop\\\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\\n\\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\\n\"},\"git\":{\"commit_hash\":\"0cd871d6a540dd92936088830d5c28897d5dfb8d\",\"branch\":\"main\",\"repository_url\":\"git@github.com:virdx/external-designs.git\"}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:02:10.477Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"message\",\"role\":\"developer\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"input_text\",\"text\":\"<permissions instructions>\\nFilesystem sandboxing defines which files can be read or written. `sandbox_mode` is `danger-full-access`: No filesystem sandboxing - all commands are permitted.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\\n</INSTRUCTIONS>\"}]}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:02:10.477Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"message\",\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"input_text\",\"text\":\"<environment_context>\\n  <cwd>/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches</cwd>\\n  <shell>zsh</shell>\\n</environment_context>\"}]}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:08:28.843Z\",\"type\":\"session_meta\",\"payload\":{\"id\":\"019c38dc-9f5d-7100-91cd-c79bbba23493\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:08:28.766Z\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches\",\"originator\":\"codex_cli_rs\",\"cli_version\":\"0.0.0\",\"source\":\"unknown\",\"model_provider\":\"openai\",\"base_instructions\":{\"text\":\"You are Codex, a coding agent based on GPT-5. You and the user share the same workspace and collaborate to achieve the user's goals.\\n\\n# Personality\\nYou are a deeply pragmatic, effective software engineer. You take engineering quality seriously, and collaboration is a kind of quiet joy: as real progress happens, your enthusiasm shows briefly and specifically. You communicate efficiently, keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail.\\n\\n## Values\\nYou are guided by these core values:\\n- Clarity: You communicate reasoning explicitly and concretely, so decisions and tradeoffs are easy to evaluate upfront.\\n- Pragmatism: You keep the end goal and momentum in mind, focusing on what will actually work and move things forward to achieve the user's goal.\\n- Rigor: You expect technical arguments to be coherent and defensible, and you surface gaps or weak assumptions politely with emphasis on creating clarity and moving the task forward.\\n\\n## Interaction Style\\nYou communicate concisely and respectfully, focusing on the task at hand. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\\n\\nGreat work and smart decisions are acknowledged, while avoiding cheerleading, motivational language, or artificial reassurance. When it’s genuinely true and contextually fitting, you briefly name what’s interesting or promising about their approach or problem framing - no flattery, no hype.\\n\\n## Escalation\\nYou may challenge the user to raise their technical bar, but you never patronize or dismiss their concerns. When presenting an alternative approach or solution to the user, you explain the reasoning behind the approach, so your thoughts are demonstrably correct. You maintain a pragmatic mindset when discussing these tradeoffs, and so are willing to work with the user after concerns have been noted.\\n\\n\\n# Working with the user\\n\\nYou interact with the user through a terminal. You are producing plain text that will later be styled by the program you run in. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value. Follow the formatting rules exactly. \\n\\n## Final answer formatting rules\\n- You may format with GitHub-flavored Markdown.\\n- Structure your answer if necessary, the complexity of the answer should match the task. If the task is simple, your answer should be a one-liner. Order sections from general to specific to supporting.\\n- Never use nested bullets. Keep lists flat (single level). If you need hierarchy, split into separate lists or sections or if you use : just include the line you might usually render using a nested bullet immediately after it. For numbered lists, only use the `1. 2. 3.` style markers (with a period), never `1)`.\\n- Headers are optional, only use them when you think they are necessary. If you do use them, use short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**. Don't add a blank line.\\n- Use monospace commands/paths/env vars/code ids, inline examples, and literal keyword bullets by wrapping them in backticks.\\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks. Include an info string as often as possible.\\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\\n  * Do not provide range of lines\\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\\\repo\\\\project\\\\main.rs:12:5\\n- Don’t use emojis.\\n\\n\\n## Presenting your work\\n- Balance conciseness to not overwhelm the user with appropriate detail for the request. Do not narrate abstractly; explain what you are doing and why.\\n- The user does not see command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\\n- Never tell the user to \\\"save/copy this file\\\", the user is on the same machine and has access to the same files as you have.\\n- If the user asks for a code explanation, structure your answer with code references.\\n- When given a simple task, just provide the outcome in a short answer without strong formatting.\\n- When you make big or complex changes, state the solution first, then walk the user through what you did and why.\\n- For casual chit-chat, just chat.\\n- If you weren't able to do something, for example run tests, tell the user.\\n- If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps. When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\\n\\n# General\\n\\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\\n\\n## Editing constraints\\n\\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \\\"Assigns the value to the variable\\\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\\n- You struggle using the git interactive console. **ALWAYS** prefer using non-interactive git commands.\\n\\n## Plan tool\\n\\nWhen using the planning tool:\\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\\n- Do not make single-step plans.\\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\\n\\n## Special user requests\\n\\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\\n- When the user asks for a review, you default to a code-review mindset. Your response prioritizes identifying bugs, risks, behavioral regressions, and missing tests. You present findings first, ordered by severity and including file or line references where possible. Open questions or assumptions follow. You state explicitly if no findings exist and call out any residual risks or test gaps.\\n\\n## Frontend tasks\\n\\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \\\"AI slop\\\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\\n\\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\\n\"},\"git\":{\"commit_hash\":\"0cd871d6a540dd92936088830d5c28897d5dfb8d\",\"branch\":\"main\",\"repository_url\":\"git@github.com:virdx/external-designs.git\"}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:08:28.843Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"message\",\"role\":\"developer\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"input_text\",\"text\":\"<permissions instructions>\\nFilesystem sandboxing defines which files can be read or written. `sandbox_mode` is `danger-full-access`: No filesystem sandboxing - all commands are permitted.

Supports greenfield creation, brownfield completion, and migration of existing styles.\\n---\\n\\n# Bootstrap Styleguide Skill\\n\\nThis skill bootstraps a comprehensive, \\\"Swiss-style\\\" brand guide and component destination in SvelteKit projects. It operates in three execution lanes depending on the project state.\\n\\n## Execution Lanes\\n\\n### Lane 1: Greenfield (Empty Directory)\\n**Trigger:** Directory is empty or near-empty (no `package.json`, no `svelte.config.js`).\\n\\n**Action:**\\n1.  **Scaffold Base Project:**\\n    Run the standard Virdx SvelteKit initialization:\\n    ```bash\\n    bun x sv create --template minimal --types ts --add tailwindcss=\\\"plugins:none\\\" mcp=\\\"ide:opencode+setup:remote\\\" --install bun .\\n    ```\\n    *(Note: Perform a dry-run first if necessary to ensure CLI behavior)*\\n\\n2.  **Proceed to Scaffolding Phase** (see below).\\n\\n### Lane 2: Brownfield (Partial/Incomplete)\\n**Trigger:** `package.json` exists but project appears incomplete (missing `src/routes`, `app.css`, or `tailwind.config.*`).\\n\\n**Action:**\\n1.  **Idempotent Check:**\\n    - Detect missing critical files (`tailwind.config.ts`, `src/app.css`, `src/routes/+layout.svelte`).\\n    - **Prompt User:** ask for permission to \\\"complete the scaffolding\\\" by creating missing files or re-running specific setup steps.\\n    - **Execute:** Fill in the gaps to reach a \\\"ready\\\" state for styleguide generation.\\n\\n2.  **Proceed to Scaffolding Phase.**\\n\\n### Lane 3: Migration (Existing Project)\\n**Trigger:** Valid SvelteKit project detected with existing styles (e.g., extensive `src/lib/components`, populated `app.css`).\\n\\n**Action:**\\n1.  **Scan & Offer:**\\n    - Detect that this is a populated project.\\n    - **Prompt User:**\\n        > \\\"I see an existing project. Do you want to scaffold the styleguide here, or migrate styles to a new location?\\\"\\n    - **Option A (Here):** Proceed to Scaffolding Phase in `src/routes/styleguide`.\\n    - **Option B (Migrate):** Ask for a target directory (inside or outside CWD). Scaffold a new Greenfiled project there (Lane 1), then help migrate content.\\n\\n2.  **Content Migration (If requested):**\\n    - Offer to scan `src/` for \\\"Candidate Files\\\" (colors, typography, logos).\\n    - Present a list of candidates to the user.\\n    - Ask for exclusions or additions.\\n    - Copy/Port selected assets to the new Styleguide's `src/lib/brand` or static assets.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Scaffolding Phase (All Lanes)\\n\\nOnce the base project is ready, this phase generates the actual `/styleguide` route and brand spec.\\n\\n### 1. Scout\\n**Goal:** Analyze the codebase to infer brand primitives.\\n*   **Input:** `tailwind.config.*`, `src/app.css`, `src/routes/+layout.svelte`.\\n*   **Output:** A structured \\\"Scout Report\\\" (markdown) listing inferred:\\n    *   Colors (Primary, Accent, Neutral)\\n    *   Typography (Fonts, Weights, Scale)\\n    *   Shapes (Radius)\\n    *   Voice (if evident)\\n\\n### 2. Clarify (User-in-the-Loop)\\n**Goal:** Validate assumptions.\\n*   **Action:** Present the Scout Report. Ask 3-5 targeted questions.\\n    *   *Example:* \\\"Is #6366f1 your primary brand color?\\\"\\n    *   *Example:* \\\"Where is your logo file located?\\\"\\n*   **Rule:** User input is authoritative.\\n\\n### 3. Generate Artifacts\\n**Goal:** Write the styleguide files.\\n*   **Reference:** Use `assets/brand-spec.schema.json` as the strict schema.\\n*   **Reference:** Use `assets/BRAND_TEMPLATE.md` as the content structure guide.\\n\\n**Files to Generate:**\\n1.  `src/lib/brand/brand.generated.json` (The Data):\\n    *   Populated with clarified data.\\n    *   Follows strict schema.\\n2.  `src/routes/styleguide/+layout.svelte` (The Frame):\\n    *   **Isolated Layout:** Do NOT import app chrome (nav/footer).\\n    *   **Style:** Clean, neutral canvas.\\n3.  `src/routes/styleguide/+page.svelte` (The Guide):\\n    *   **Visuals:** Swiss-style presentation (Grid-based, ample whitespace).\\n    *   **Sections:** Header, Logo, Colors, Typography, Patterns, Voice, Resources.\\n    *   **Implementation:** Read `brand.generated.json` and render it.\\n    *   **Tech:** Svelte 5 Runes syntax.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Assets\\n*   `assets/brand-spec.schema.json`: JSON Schema for the brand data model.\\n*   `assets/BRAND_TEMPLATE.md`: Markdown template for brand content.\\n\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:08:44.296Z\",\"type\":\"turn_context\",\"payload\":{\"cwd\":\"/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches\",\"approval_policy\":\"never\",\"sandbox_policy\":{\"type\":\"danger-full-access\"},\"model\":\"gpt-5.2-codex\",\"personality\":\"pragmatic\",\"collaboration_mode\":{\"mode\":\"default\",\"settings\":{\"model\":\"gpt-5.2-codex\",\"reasoning_effort\":\"medium\",\"developer_instructions\":null}},\"effort\":\"medium\",\"summary\":\"auto\",\"user_instructions\":\"# AGENTS.md\\n\\nLightweight collaboration rules for this repo.\\n\\n## Multi-Repo Context\\n\\nThese repos work together during tendrils development:\\n- **tendrils** (`/Users/l/Dev/tendrils`) - The extraction/transplantation tool\\n- **virdx-sandboxed** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sandboxed`) - Knit target AND extract source, original testbed\\n- **virdx-sketches** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches`) - Knit target for testing\\n- **virdx-site** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-site`) - Extract source ONLY, read-only, different Histology version\\n\\n## Core Philosophy\\n\\n1. **Ephemeral by design** - Manifests/snapshots are session-scoped decision aids, not persistent system-of-record.

The extraction/transplantation tool\\n- **virdx-sandboxed** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sandboxed`) - Knit target AND extract source, original testbed\\n- **virdx-sketches** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches`) - Knit target for testing\\n- **virdx-site** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-site`) - Extract source ONLY, read-only, different Histology version\\n\\n## Core Philosophy\\n\\n1. **Ephemeral by design** - Manifests/snapshots are session-scoped decision aids, not persistent system-of-record. No drift detection, no staleness tracking.\\n\\n2. **80/20 wins** - Lightweight solutions providing 80% value at 20% complexity always preferred over \\\"complete\\\" solutions with 4x complexity for diminishing returns.\\n\\n3. **MVP first** - Ship working features before perfecting. We're extracting Histology, not building a universal platform.\\n\\n4. **Static determinability** - Only promise what can be statically determined. Context contracts ARE static; full composition graphs are runtime phenomena.\\n\\n5. **Iterative gap handling** - When testing reveals gaps, formalize as patterns not band-aids. Ask: \\\"What class of problem is this?\\\"\\n\\n6. **User manages context** - Tool provides metadata, user manages naming/organization.\\n\\n7. **Warn and continue** - Dirty state gets warning, doesn't block. Fits ephemeral philosophy.\\n\\n8. **Machine-first output** - JSON to stdout, logs to stderr. Feeds LLM agents, not humans scanning terminals.\\n\\n## Living Documents\\n\\n1. `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` are living documents.\\n2. Any changes in project structure, tooling, or philosophy must flow back into both files.\\n3. Prefer full rewrites over patch updates to prevent complexity creep.\\n\\n## README Freshness\\n\\n1. The README must always reflect the current state of the sandbox.\\n2. When updating the README, do a full rewrite instead of appending sections.\\n3. Remove information that is more than 7 days old unless it is still actively relevant.\\n\\n## Agent Workflow (OODA + Fail-Fast)\\n\\nAgent work follows an OODA-inspired loop with nested user feedback:\\n\\n1. **Observe**: Read code state, plans, prompts, existing artifacts.\\n\\n2. **Orient**: File exploration, MCP tool search, fan-out subagents for research. Critical user feedback discussion (may span multiple turns). Depending on outcome, may restart Observe/Orient.\\n\\n3. **Decide**: Synthesize findings, present plan with alternatives and choices for approval. Interview-style discussion with user. User may request further research. Final approval is user-gated before implementation.\\n\\n4. **Act**: Implementation proceeds only after user approval. Test-first, self-documenting code.\\n\\n## User Input Gates\\n\\nAlways ask the user when:\\n1. Aesthetic decisions arise (naming, structuring, code taste).\\n2. Non-obvious choices exist (architectures, patterns, libraries, tradeoffs between options).\\n\\n## Code Standards\\n\\n1. Test-first development\\n2. Prefer bun/uv ecosystems\\n3. All emojis banned in code, logs, docs (except semantic color circles)\\n4. Avoid over-engineering - only features needed for current use case\\n5. Write clear, self-documenting code\\n\\n## Agent Folders Policy\\n\\n**NEVER gitignore** the following directories - they contain project-specific agent steering, tooling, or skills that MUST be committed and move with the project:\\n\\n- `.claude/`\\n- `.codex/`\\n- `.gemini/`\\n- `.agent/`\\n- `.agents/`\\n\\nThese folders are first-class project artifacts, not ephemeral session data.\\n\\n## Repo Role\\n\\nThis repo serves as a fresh knit target for testing tendrils transplantation:\\n- Clean slate for testing extracted components\\n- Brand system integration testing\\n- Validation of knit workflow on minimal projects\\n\\n## Smart Upstreaming Flow\\n\\nExtract → Knit → Modify → Re-extract → Re-knit back to origin\\n\\nUser manages this flow explicitly; manifests provide context.\\n\\n\\n## Skills\\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\n### Available skills\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n### How to use skills\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\",\"truncation_policy\":{\"mode\":\"tokens\",\"limit\":10000}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:09:01.736Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"token_count\",\"info\":{\"total_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":129063,\"cached_input_tokens\":100480,\"output_tokens\":274,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":0,\"total_tokens\":129337},\"last_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":19021,\"cached_input_tokens\":17920,\"output_tokens\":60,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":0,\"total_tokens\":19081},\"model_context_window\":258400},\"rate_limits\":{\"primary\":{\"used_percent\":1.0,\"window_minutes\":300,\"resets_at\":1770498521},\"secondary\":{\"used_percent\":92.0,\"window_minutes\":10080,\"resets_at\":1770660258},\"credits\":{\"has_credits\":false,\"unlimited\":false,\"balance\":null},\"plan_type\":null}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:09:04.827Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"agent_reasoning\",\"text\":\"**Checking existing styleguide files**\\n\\nI'll review the current styleguide files to understand the existing styling approach before deciding how to handle the missing tailwind/app.css.\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:09:04.827Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"reasoning\",\"summary\":[{\"type\":\"summary_text\",\"text\":\"**Checking existing styleguide files**\\n\\nI'll review the current styleguide files to understand the existing styling approach before deciding how to handle the missing tailwind/app.css.\"}],\"content\":null,\"encrypted_content\":\"gAAAAABph2OgoGMyVJYojsE6082qSdSc7eeCKCavCFVDUNVaWo87y0-RtE7b5bpKeXpJ-9nI-Aj4PLaqRDzDO0xXkz1s11BFtVC0-gXONa75217IxER8c3334v0aVDJ7TnEvzh1vSp5Y9BPy1pD1aD1L4ZkkTCb_h_MZsFWJzdAdQS341g9TVht2LxIEG_S8j2R7ep41IQqrwBLOXNAShkS79kPSbSCEs-c7I2gDtLm_FWVyZyUXkKJDvX2TW2bxM7O57_eU7cgaS74lxE-pyssfYk3DrLENFqm7Weks5aGmUeqkCewDUpYQFvvbsu2lF85t26h0GOD_Ak5GoJ9bLpejeDBhJdHHDcgK-_SF14HXdvQOMSadr3X4WOGyfQ_UltnvXMu0cxEsPB6Hr73XWWXTfOPbOIyq6jZ-oEpFUuoGU4qoYyO1FbfXRHx7OE6sEOKMqhqtB0pzcRzjoAFxD-hyM_df9-BEuELZ9UKUK3KdLLxj4TNwoDjfyl1Ev6s8rrZVnK0EgpX3kUqe8P58QuInlpUymIbnncHtXtL0OActqD5kRDQy1pSpWnjwyO8x7VbK2I-hGjIjZltcDLR-IxZ5eInQBv8Lwgb_fqzdLMMeZOaEnSjitd2PArRbX0Ekmubb-HCFqVQHNPdqsWbiYa4rxHzEC4IzCfQYFguKqSuixP-VYIdOfF70cr7vAKTbme5tCwNFDDL9WylJjEA_yOTKOyntYoHl2Zl_b1kMi0BJ5aVetLmN0wQR1nK-5CKAL-o72leEtodP0fFzQ_uNwVwDFvheqaDIwFGoKWdul2O95cg6aA_hXXCbcZ8AtnVwLNwPKtU1OXbd-DAipuaB_H7NCxHGWYrHfdEjrJwOOuPWkGsa8tOv6-D1CmtTTFEWKmvzN8cUbbZjMqyixZIhKggq9AU5b7lAFhkC2O-HtBgNWPv2Hn83jiC446Ly4c5i4bxS2ZcOSXe9V-J8R1lEJ4xQhvmyifw-JqRJE0ANoNkb-XqUxLOc1aMaBvOAwSQDyJfqUk-9c205maNqG2bRZd0_9JmfMfxfGKp5-qPsgba8A2kAuiTxYhw=\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:09:05.180Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"function_call\",\"name\":\"exec_command\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cmd\\\":\\\"sed -n '1,200p' src/routes/styleguide/+page.svelte\\\"}\",\"call_id\":\"call_8iX2USkseRjZ86t5N9uLDlXr\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:09:05.182Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"token_count\",\"info\":{\"total_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":148186,\"cached_input_tokens\":119424,\"output_tokens\":349,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":0,\"total_tokens\":148535},\"last_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":19123,\"cached_input_tokens\":18944,\"output_tokens\":75,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":0,\"total_tokens\":19198},\"model_context_window\":258400},\"rate_limits\":{\"primary\":{\"used_percent\":1.0,\"window_minutes\":300,\"resets_at\":1770498521},\"secondary\":{\"used_percent\":92.0,\"window_minutes\":10080,\"resets_at\":1770660258},\"credits\":{\"has_credits\":false,\"unlimited\":false,\"balance\":null},\"plan_type\":null}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:09:05.267Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"function_call_output\",\"call_id\":\"call_8iX2USkseRjZ86t5N9uLDlXr\",\"output\":\"Chunk ID: c28727\\nWall time: 0.0520 seconds\\nProcess exited with code 0\\nOriginal token count: 1326\\nOutput:\\n<script lang=\\\"ts\\\">\\n  import type { BrandSpec, ColorToken, TypeScaleEntry, SayVsDontSay } from '$lib/brand/brand-spec';\\n\\n  // In a real implementation, this would be:\\n  // import spec from '$lib/brand/brand.generated.json';\\n  // For now, we use a placeholder that demonstrates all sections.\\n\\n  const spec: BrandSpec = $state({\\n    meta: {\\n      name: 'Brand Name',\\n      tagline: 'A living document.

Knit target for testing\\n- **virdx-site** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-site`) - Extract source ONLY, read-only, different Histology version\\n\\n## Core Philosophy\\n\\n1. **Ephemeral by design** - Manifests/snapshots are session-scoped decision aids, not persistent system-of-record. No drift detection, no staleness tracking.\\n\\n2. **80/20 wins** - Lightweight solutions providing 80% value at 20% complexity always preferred over \\\"complete\\\" solutions with 4x complexity for diminishing returns.\\n\\n3. **MVP first** - Ship working features before perfecting. We're extracting Histology, not building a universal platform.\\n\\n4. **Static determinability** - Only promise what can be statically determined. Context contracts ARE static; full composition graphs are runtime phenomena.\\n\\n5. **Iterative gap handling** - When testing reveals gaps, formalize as patterns not band-aids. Ask: \\\"What class of problem is this?\\\"\\n\\n6. **User manages context** - Tool provides metadata, user manages naming/organization.\\n\\n7. **Warn and continue** - Dirty state gets warning, doesn't block.

Any changes in project structure, tooling, or philosophy must flow back into both files.\\n3. Prefer full rewrites over patch updates to prevent complexity creep.\\n\\n## README Freshness\\n\\n1.

Critical user feedback discussion (may span multiple turns). Depending on outcome, may restart Observe/Orient.\\n\\n3. **Decide**: Synthesize findings, present plan with alternatives and choices for approval. Interview-style discussion with user.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\n### Available skills\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n### How to use skills\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\n### Available skills\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n### How to use skills\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\",\"truncation_policy\":{\"mode\":\"tokens\",\"limit\":10000}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:09:11.997Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"token_count\",\"info\":{\"total_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":191123,\"cached_input_tokens\":155904,\"output_tokens\":417,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":0,\"total_tokens\":191540},\"last_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":22246,\"cached_input_tokens\":17408,\"output_tokens\":34,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":0,\"total_tokens\":22280},\"model_context_window\":258400},\"rate_limits\":{\"primary\":{\"used_percent\":1.0,\"window_minutes\":300,\"resets_at\":1770498521},\"secondary\":{\"used_percent\":92.0,\"window_minutes\":10080,\"resets_at\":1770660258},\"credits\":{\"has_credits\":false,\"unlimited\":false,\"balance\":null},\"plan_type\":null}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:09:14.781Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"agent_reasoning\",\"text\":\"**Checking brand files**\\n\\nI'm verifying the presence and structure of brand-related files like brand.generated.json and layout to match the skill's requirements.\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:09:14.781Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"reasoning\",\"summary\":[{\"type\":\"summary_text\",\"text\":\"**Checking brand files**\\n\\nI'm verifying the presence and structure of brand-related files like brand.generated.json and layout to match the skill's requirements.\"}],\"content\":null,\"encrypted_content\":\"gAAAAABph2OqZ-Oqh0MdxIMD0TcVLcjXHPsRezmziqMLF1gcGlAVx1jWJfKhjYNU9TBqw8-Jru5bmq5CIr4biFshHEaWsjk0dKFXFVvzDRW2s3jPgs5aEBndv8o6TM1ASFD3M1UlsESHH4Ao97F8OEjkps9NE4aOqgoW9s3miFIxYQgusuMWRG5GAqGVs7qFhKKygQD6apElLPrrVG1TKmIJJeMN-818BrkFT7m_GPh5Y6H4-uhTEgIDeAk_CrTQhug7zpCtbM0nmpGfmUiEm9Czulj3him9rBVGgEdjxwWWS4YYb8R141fzISAO_uiC-WEbdemdRZwEtMqyHUZ69rSmxYTXm6o_NEcBgJYdnB1sjzWhdLowuRVMEEyBq5HrazJXOM-XnrAGzdglkABa-bkEpMSTcCSu5HoIZmYAnx6cOqPv62rMYlvzFLZ0foPcPzwzticdtxA1rgMk-VyUG--2N20CPbPJHqZ_If3z5AwmcdsOable6oIm5ZbE2BAJS3_XtWVwhOoOYi_AIFOg8jBuSIcRszOnHMAE0IL5-rjlV4Gb-Bu3RUpaDbAdts-kqxn3AqN0tXVoeTObR9RuDSAdu1uHUVVfddsoxyQod1yu4FDPvqe4mnGY0dpXzKTiLx5zonp6Nr5rZ_RaSJP0iT2qnmwJeVizF1DFKQGB46irZ8cSd3ca88njvZVpgcUqpv7GDiErOfrfzYhsRoML9WB5UJ7EX1f8wgb4Xk5w_60UU-mkA5dC1GWaVf2GCr2wUVyV2aKrlLYK2w_FJt6ShqeAoS__egyqzdYlHTotQ2zEkjwf8fkpUGXmmuNoCQ2RNrK-YP_cWl8rHLMkcJQ6I88GaK5c74uvz2GrS8_wYV1a8kRMBrxv6SFJ_VNgDXHYC5SpQvnTiiN2DRbtSd0cwQ5ndSu9-uCu0d-Y5W8caOG1ZM_c5JsiyQefsjk4CiAdzb5v1xKt3Gsi_GphlEuIlSVDb1srl64qFg==\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:09:15.045Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"function_call\",\"name\":\"exec_command\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cmd\\\":\\\"ls src/lib/brand\\\"}\",\"call_id\":\"call_3s82MN9GVE5oNKwRiYhm8uu1\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:09:15.150Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"token_count\",\"info\":{\"total_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":214256,\"cached_input_tokens\":176512,\"output_tokens\":467,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":0,\"total_tokens\":214723},\"last_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":23133,\"cached_input_tokens\":20608,\"output_tokens\":50,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":0,\"total_tokens\":23183},\"model_context_window\":258400},\"rate_limits\":{\"primary\":{\"used_percent\":1.0,\"window_minutes\":300,\"resets_at\":1770498521},\"secondary\":{\"used_percent\":92.0,\"window_minutes\":10080,\"resets_at\":1770660258},\"credits\":{\"has_credits\":false,\"unlimited\":false,\"balance\":null},\"plan_type\":null}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:09:15.150Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"function_call_output\",\"call_id\":\"call_3s82MN9GVE5oNKwRiYhm8uu1\",\"output\":\"Chunk ID: 9a8670\\nWall time: 0.0518 seconds\\nProcess exited with code 0\\nOriginal token count: 4\\nOutput:\\nbrand-spec.ts\\n\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:09:15.151Z\",\"type\":\"turn_context\",\"payload\":{\"cwd\":\"/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches\",\"approval_policy\":\"never\",\"sandbox_policy\":{\"type\":\"danger-full-access\"},\"model\":\"gpt-5.2-codex\",\"personality\":\"pragmatic\",\"collaboration_mode\":{\"mode\":\"default\",\"settings\":{\"model\":\"gpt-5.2-codex\",\"reasoning_effort\":\"medium\",\"developer_instructions\":null}},\"effort\":\"medium\",\"summary\":\"auto\",\"user_instructions\":\"# AGENTS.md\\n\\nLightweight collaboration rules for this repo.\\n\\n## Multi-Repo Context\\n\\nThese repos work together during tendrils development:\\n- **tendrils** (`/Users/l/Dev/tendrils`) -

No drift detection, no staleness tracking.\\n\\n2. **80/20 wins** - Lightweight solutions providing 80% value at 20% complexity always preferred over \\\"complete\\\" solutions with 4x complexity for diminishing returns.\\n\\n3. **MVP first** - Ship working features before perfecting. We're extracting Histology, not building a universal platform.\\n\\n4. **Static determinability** - Only promise what can be statically determined. Context contracts ARE static; full composition graphs are runtime phenomena.\\n\\n5. **Iterative gap handling** - When testing reveals gaps, formalize as patterns not band-aids. Ask: \\\"What class of problem is this?\\\"\\n\\n6. **User manages context** - Tool provides metadata, user manages naming/organization.\\n\\n7. **Warn and continue** - Dirty state gets warning, doesn't block. Fits ephemeral philosophy.\\n\\n8. **Machine-first output** - JSON to stdout, logs to stderr. Feeds LLM agents, not humans scanning terminals.\\n\\n## Living Documents\\n\\n1. `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` are living documents.\\n2. Any changes in project structure, tooling, or philosophy must flow back into both files.\\n3. Prefer full rewrites over patch updates to prevent complexity creep.\\n\\n## README Freshness\\n\\n1. The README must always reflect the current state of the sandbox.\\n2. When updating the README, do a full rewrite instead of appending sections.\\n3. Remove information that is more than 7 days old unless it is still actively relevant.\\n\\n## Agent Workflow (OODA + Fail-Fast)\\n\\nAgent work follows an OODA-inspired loop with nested user feedback:\\n\\n1. **Observe**: Read code state, plans, prompts, existing artifacts.\\n\\n2. **Orient**: File exploration, MCP tool search, fan-out subagents for research. Critical user feedback discussion (may span multiple turns). Depending on outcome, may restart Observe/Orient.\\n\\n3. **Decide**: Synthesize findings, present plan with alternatives and choices for approval. Interview-style discussion with user. User may request further research. Final approval is user-gated before implementation.\\n\\n4. **Act**: Implementation proceeds only after user approval. Test-first, self-documenting code.\\n\\n## User Input Gates\\n\\nAlways ask the user when:\\n1. Aesthetic decisions arise (naming, structuring, code taste).\\n2. Non-obvious choices exist (architectures, patterns, libraries, tradeoffs between options).\\n\\n## Code Standards\\n\\n1. Test-first development\\n2. Prefer bun/uv ecosystems\\n3. All emojis banned in code, logs, docs (except semantic color circles)\\n4. Avoid over-engineering - only features needed for current use case\\n5. Write clear, self-documenting code\\n\\n## Agent Folders Policy\\n\\n**NEVER gitignore** the following directories - they contain project-specific agent steering, tooling, or skills that MUST be committed and move with the project:\\n\\n- `.claude/`\\n- `.codex/`\\n- `.gemini/`\\n- `.agent/`\\n- `.agents/`\\n\\nThese folders are first-class project artifacts, not ephemeral session data.\\n\\n## Repo Role\\n\\nThis repo serves as a fresh knit target for testing tendrils transplantation:\\n- Clean slate for testing extracted components\\n- Brand system integration testing\\n- Validation of knit workflow on minimal projects\\n\\n## Smart Upstreaming Flow\\n\\nExtract → Knit → Modify → Re-extract → Re-knit back to origin\\n\\nUser manages this flow explicitly; manifests provide context.\\n\\n\\n## Skills\\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\n### Available skills\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n### How to use skills\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and

No drift detection, no staleness tracking.\\n\\n2. **80/20 wins** - Lightweight solutions providing 80% value at 20% complexity always preferred over \\\"complete\\\" solutions with 4x complexity for diminishing returns.\\n\\n3. **MVP first** - Ship working features before perfecting. We're extracting Histology, not building a universal platform.\\n\\n4. **Static determinability** - Only promise what can be statically determined. Context contracts ARE static; full composition graphs are runtime phenomena.\\n\\n5. **Iterative gap handling** - When testing reveals gaps, formalize as patterns not band-aids. Ask: \\\"What class of problem is this?\\\"\\n\\n6. **User manages context** - Tool provides metadata, user manages naming/organization.\\n\\n7. **Warn and continue** - Dirty state gets warning, doesn't block.

Feeds LLM agents, not humans scanning terminals.\\n\\n## Living Documents\\n\\n1. `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` are living documents.\\n2. Any changes in project structure, tooling, or philosophy must flow back into both files.\\n3. Prefer full rewrites over patch updates to prevent complexity creep.\\n\\n## README Freshness\\n\\n1. The README must always reflect the current state of the sandbox.\\n2. When updating the README, do a full rewrite instead of appending sections.\\n3. Remove information that is more than 7 days old unless it is still actively relevant.\\n\\n## Agent Workflow (OODA + Fail-Fast)\\n\\nAgent work follows an OODA-inspired loop with nested user feedback:\\n\\n1. **Observe**: Read code state, plans, prompts, existing artifacts.\\n\\n2. **Orient**: File exploration, MCP tool search, fan-out subagents for research. Critical user feedback discussion (may span multiple turns). Depending on outcome, may restart Observe/Orient.\\n\\n3. **Decide**: Synthesize findings, present plan with alternatives and choices for approval. Interview-style discussion with user. User may request further research. Final approval is user-gated before implementation.\\n\\n4. **Act**: Implementation proceeds only after user approval. Test-first, self-documenting code.\\n\\n## User Input Gates\\n\\nAlways ask the user when:\\n1. Aesthetic decisions arise (naming, structuring, code taste).\\n2. Non-obvious choices exist (architectures, patterns, libraries, tradeoffs between options).\\n\\n## Code Standards\\n\\n1. Test-first development\\n2. Prefer bun/uv ecosystems\\n3.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\n### Available skills\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n### How to use skills\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\",\"truncation_policy\":{\"mode\":\"tokens\",\"limit\":10000}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:09:23.879Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"token_count\",\"info\":{\"total_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":260920,\"cached_input_tokens\":222848,\"output_tokens\":665,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":64,\"total_tokens\":261585},\"last_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":23434,\"cached_input_tokens\":23296,\"output_tokens\":46,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":0,\"total_tokens\":23480},\"model_context_window\":258400},\"rate_limits\":{\"primary\":{\"used_percent\":2.0,\"window_minutes\":300,\"resets_at\":1770498521},\"secondary\":{\"used_percent\":92.0,\"window_minutes\":10080,\"resets_at\":1770660258},\"credits\":{\"has_credits\":false,\"unlimited\":false,\"balance\":null},\"plan_type\":null}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:09:26.175Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"agent_reasoning\",\"text\":\"**Checking

No drift detection, no staleness tracking.\\n\\n2. **80/20 wins** - Lightweight solutions providing 80% value at 20% complexity always preferred over \\\"complete\\\" solutions with 4x complexity for diminishing returns.\\n\\n3. **MVP first** - Ship working features before perfecting. We're extracting Histology, not building a universal platform.\\n\\n4. **Static determinability** - Only promise what can be statically determined. Context contracts ARE static; full composition graphs are runtime phenomena.\\n\\n5. **Iterative gap handling** - When testing reveals gaps, formalize as patterns not band-aids. Ask: \\\"What class of problem is this?\\\"\\n\\n6. **User manages context** - Tool provides metadata, user manages naming/organization.\\n\\n7. **Warn and continue** - Dirty state gets warning, doesn't block. Fits ephemeral philosophy.\\n\\n8. **Machine-first output** - JSON to stdout, logs to stderr. Feeds LLM agents, not humans scanning terminals.\\n\\n## Living Documents\\n\\n1. `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` are living documents.\\n2. Any changes in project structure, tooling, or philosophy must flow back into both files.\\n3. Prefer full rewrites over patch updates to prevent complexity creep.\\n\\n## README Freshness\\n\\n1. The README must always reflect the current state of the sandbox.\\n2. When updating the README, do a full rewrite instead of appending sections.\\n3. Remove information that is more than 7 days old unless it is still actively relevant.\\n\\n## Agent Workflow (OODA + Fail-Fast)\\n\\nAgent work follows an OODA-inspired loop with nested user feedback:\\n\\n1. **Observe**: Read code state, plans, prompts, existing artifacts.\\n\\n2. **Orient**: File exploration, MCP tool search, fan-out subagents for research. Critical user feedback discussion (may span multiple turns). Depending on outcome, may restart Observe/Orient.\\n\\n3. **Decide**: Synthesize findings, present plan with alternatives and choices for approval. Interview-style discussion with user. User may request further research. Final approval is user-gated before implementation.\\n\\n4. **Act**: Implementation proceeds only after user approval. Test-first, self-documenting code.\\n\\n## User Input Gates\\n\\nAlways ask the user when:\\n1. Aesthetic decisions arise (naming, structuring, code taste).\\n2. Non-obvious choices exist (architectures, patterns, libraries, tradeoffs between options).\\n\\n## Code Standards\\n\\n1. Test-first development\\n2. Prefer bun/uv ecosystems\\n3. All emojis banned in code, logs, docs (except semantic color circles)\\n4. Avoid over-engineering - only features needed for current use case\\n5. Write clear, self-documenting code\\n\\n## Agent Folders Policy\\n\\n**NEVER gitignore** the following directories - they contain project-specific agent steering, tooling, or skills that MUST be committed and move with the project:\\n\\n- `.claude/`\\n- `.codex/`\\n- `.gemini/`\\n- `.agent/`\\n- `.agents/`\\n\\nThese folders are first-class project artifacts, not ephemeral session data.\\n\\n## Repo Role\\n\\nThis repo serves as a fresh knit target for testing tendrils transplantation:\\n- Clean slate for testing extracted components\\n- Brand system integration testing\\n- Validation of knit workflow on minimal projects\\n\\n## Smart Upstreaming Flow\\n\\nExtract → Knit → Modify → Re-extract → Re-knit back to origin\\n\\nUser manages this flow explicitly; manifests provide context.\\n\\n\\n## Skills\\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\n### Available skills\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n### How to use skills\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\",\"truncation_policy\":{\"mode\":\"tokens\",\"limit\":10000}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:14:51.532Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"token_count\",\"info\":{\"total_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":310455,\"cached_input_tokens\":270336,\"output_tokens\":1321,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":320,\"total_tokens\":311776},\"last_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":24889,\"cached_input_tokens\":24064,\"output_tokens\":570,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":256,\"total_tokens\":25459},\"model_context_window\":258400},\"rate_limits\":{\"primary\":{\"used_percent\":2.0,\"window_minutes\":300,\"resets_at\":1770498521},\"secondary\":{\"used_percent\":92.0,\"window_minutes\":10080,\"resets_at\":1770660258},\"credits\":{\"has_credits\":false,\"unlimited\":false,\"balance\":null},\"plan_type\":null}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:14:57.235Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"agent_reasoning\",\"text\":\"**Confirming

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\n### Available skills\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n### How to use skills\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\",\"truncation_policy\":{\"mode\":\"tokens\",\"limit\":10000}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:14:58.387Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"token_count\",\"info\":{\"total_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":335292,\"cached_input_tokens\":287616,\"output_tokens\":1581,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":512,\"total_tokens\":336873},\"last_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":24837,\"cached_input_tokens\":17280,\"output_tokens\":260,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":192,\"total_tokens\":25097},\"model_context_window\":258400},\"rate_limits\":{\"primary\":{\"used_percent\":2.0,\"window_minutes\":300,\"resets_at\":1770498521},\"secondary\":{\"used_percent\":92.0,\"window_minutes\":10080,\"resets_at\":1770660258},\"credits\":{\"has_credits\":false,\"unlimited\":false,\"balance\":null},\"plan_type\":null}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:15:01.379Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"agent_reasoning\",\"text\":\"**Attempting

The extraction/transplantation tool\\n- **virdx-sandboxed** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sandboxed`) - Knit target AND extract source, original testbed\\n- **virdx-sketches** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches`) - Knit target for testing\\n- **virdx-site** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-site`) - Extract source ONLY, read-only, different Histology version\\n\\n## Core Philosophy\\n\\n1. **Ephemeral by design** - Manifests/snapshots are session-scoped decision aids, not persistent system-of-record. No drift detection, no staleness tracking.\\n\\n2. **80/20 wins** - Lightweight solutions providing 80% value at 20% complexity always preferred over \\\"complete\\\" solutions with 4x complexity for diminishing returns.\\n\\n3. **MVP first** - Ship working features before perfecting. We're extracting Histology, not building a universal platform.\\n\\n4. **Static determinability** - Only promise what can be statically determined. Context contracts ARE static; full composition graphs are runtime phenomena.\\n\\n5. **Iterative gap handling** - When testing reveals gaps, formalize as patterns not band-aids. Ask: \\\"What class of problem is this?\\\"\\n\\n6. **User manages context** - Tool provides metadata, user manages naming/organization.\\n\\n7. **Warn and continue** - Dirty state gets warning, doesn't block. Fits ephemeral philosophy.\\n\\n8. **Machine-first output** - JSON to stdout, logs to stderr. Feeds LLM agents, not humans scanning terminals.\\n\\n## Living Documents\\n\\n1. `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` are living documents.\\n2. Any changes in project structure, tooling, or philosophy must flow back into both files.\\n3. Prefer full rewrites over patch updates to prevent complexity creep.\\n\\n## README Freshness\\n\\n1. The README must always reflect the current state of the sandbox.\\n2. When updating the README, do a full rewrite instead of appending sections.\\n3. Remove information that is more than 7 days old unless it is still actively relevant.\\n\\n## Agent Workflow (OODA + Fail-Fast)\\n\\nAgent work follows an OODA-inspired loop with nested user feedback:\\n\\n1. **Observe**: Read code state, plans, prompts, existing artifacts.\\n\\n2. **Orient**: File exploration, MCP tool search, fan-out subagents for research. Critical user feedback discussion (may span multiple turns). Depending on outcome, may restart Observe/Orient.\\n\\n3. **Decide**: Synthesize findings, present plan with alternatives and choices for approval. Interview-style discussion with user. User may request further research. Final approval is user-gated before implementation.\\n\\n4. **Act**: Implementation proceeds only after user approval. Test-first, self-documenting code.\\n\\n## User Input Gates\\n\\nAlways ask the user when:\\n1. Aesthetic decisions arise (naming, structuring, code taste).\\n2. Non-obvious choices exist (architectures, patterns, libraries, tradeoffs between options).\\n\\n## Code Standards\\n\\n1. Test-first development\\n2. Prefer bun/uv ecosystems\\n3. All emojis banned in code, logs, docs (except semantic color circles)\\n4. Avoid over-engineering - only features needed for current use case\\n5. Write clear, self-documenting code\\n\\n## Agent Folders Policy\\n\\n**NEVER gitignore** the following directories - they contain project-specific agent steering, tooling, or skills that MUST be committed and move with the project:\\n\\n- `.claude/`\\n- `.codex/`\\n- `.gemini/`\\n- `.agent/`\\n- `.agents/`\\n\\nThese folders are first-class project artifacts, not ephemeral session data.\\n\\n## Repo Role\\n\\nThis repo serves as a fresh knit target for testing tendrils transplantation:\\n- Clean slate for testing extracted components\\n- Brand system integration testing\\n- Validation of knit workflow on minimal projects\\n\\n## Smart Upstreaming Flow\\n\\nExtract → Knit → Modify → Re-extract → Re-knit back to origin\\n\\nUser manages this flow explicitly; manifests provide context.\\n\\n\\n## Skills\\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\n### Available skills\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n### How to use skills\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

No drift detection, no staleness tracking.\\n\\n2. **80/20 wins** - Lightweight solutions providing 80% value at 20% complexity always preferred over \\\"complete\\\" solutions with 4x complexity for diminishing returns.\\n\\n3. **MVP first** - Ship working features before perfecting. We're extracting Histology, not building a universal platform.\\n\\n4. **Static determinability** - Only promise what can be statically determined. Context contracts ARE static; full composition graphs are runtime phenomena.\\n\\n5. **Iterative gap handling** - When testing reveals gaps, formalize as patterns not band-aids. Ask: \\\"What class of problem is this?\\\"\\n\\n6. **User manages context** - Tool provides metadata, user manages naming/organization.\\n\\n7. **Warn and continue** - Dirty state gets warning, doesn't block. Fits ephemeral philosophy.\\n\\n8. **Machine-first output** - JSON to stdout, logs to stderr. Feeds LLM agents, not humans scanning terminals.\\n\\n## Living Documents\\n\\n1. `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` are living documents.\\n2. Any changes in project structure, tooling, or philosophy must flow back into both files.\\n3. Prefer full rewrites over patch updates to prevent complexity creep.\\n\\n## README Freshness\\n\\n1. The README must always reflect the current state of the sandbox.\\n2. When updating the README, do a full rewrite instead of appending sections.\\n3. Remove information that is more than 7 days old unless it is still actively relevant.\\n\\n## Agent Workflow (OODA + Fail-Fast)\\n\\nAgent work follows an OODA-inspired loop with nested user feedback:\\n\\n1. **Observe**: Read code state, plans, prompts, existing artifacts.\\n\\n2. **Orient**: File exploration, MCP tool search, fan-out subagents for research. Critical user feedback discussion (may span multiple turns). Depending on outcome, may restart Observe/Orient.\\n\\n3. **Decide**: Synthesize findings, present plan with alternatives and choices for approval. Interview-style discussion with user. User may request further research. Final approval is user-gated before implementation.\\n\\n4. **Act**: Implementation proceeds only after user approval. Test-first, self-documenting code.\\n\\n## User Input Gates\\n\\nAlways ask the user when:\\n1. Aesthetic decisions arise (naming, structuring, code taste).\\n2. Non-obvious choices exist (architectures, patterns, libraries, tradeoffs between options).\\n\\n## Code Standards\\n\\n1. Test-first development\\n2. Prefer bun/uv ecosystems\\n3. All emojis banned in code, logs, docs (except semantic color circles)\\n4. Avoid over-engineering - only features needed for current use case\\n5. Write clear, self-documenting code\\n\\n## Agent Folders Policy\\n\\n**NEVER gitignore** the following directories - they contain project-specific agent steering, tooling, or skills that MUST be committed and move with the project:\\n\\n- `.claude/`\\n- `.codex/`\\n- `.gemini/`\\n- `.agent/`\\n- `.agents/`\\n\\nThese folders are first-class project artifacts, not ephemeral session data.\\n\\n## Repo Role\\n\\nThis repo serves as a fresh knit target for testing tendrils transplantation:\\n- Clean slate for testing extracted components\\n- Brand system integration testing\\n- Validation of knit workflow on minimal projects\\n\\n## Smart Upstreaming Flow\\n\\nExtract → Knit → Modify → Re-extract → Re-knit back to origin\\n\\nUser manages this flow explicitly; manifests provide context.\\n\\n\\n## Skills\\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\n### Available skills\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n### How to use skills\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all.

No drift detection, no staleness tracking.\\n\\n2. **80/20 wins** - Lightweight solutions providing 80% value at 20% complexity always preferred over \\\"complete\\\" solutions with 4x complexity for diminishing returns.\\n\\n3. **MVP first** - Ship working features before perfecting. We're extracting Histology, not building a universal platform.\\n\\n4. **Static determinability** - Only promise what can be statically determined. Context contracts ARE static; full composition graphs are runtime phenomena.\\n\\n5. **Iterative gap handling** - When testing reveals gaps, formalize as patterns not band-aids. Ask: \\\"What class of problem is this?\\\"\\n\\n6. **User manages context** - Tool provides metadata, user manages naming/organization.\\n\\n7. **Warn and continue** - Dirty state gets warning, doesn't block. Fits ephemeral philosophy.\\n\\n8. **Machine-first output** - JSON to stdout, logs to stderr. Feeds LLM agents, not humans scanning terminals.\\n\\n## Living Documents\\n\\n1. `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` are living documents.\\n2. Any changes in project structure, tooling, or philosophy must flow back into both files.\\n3. Prefer full rewrites over patch updates to prevent complexity creep.\\n\\n## README Freshness\\n\\n1. The README must always reflect the current state of the sandbox.\\n2. When updating the README, do a full rewrite instead of appending sections.\\n3. Remove information that is more than 7 days old unless it is still actively relevant.\\n\\n## Agent Workflow (OODA + Fail-Fast)\\n\\nAgent work follows an OODA-inspired loop with nested user feedback:\\n\\n1. **Observe**: Read code state, plans, prompts, existing artifacts.\\n\\n2. **Orient**: File exploration, MCP tool search, fan-out subagents for research. Critical user feedback discussion (may span multiple turns). Depending on outcome, may restart Observe/Orient.\\n\\n3. **Decide**: Synthesize findings, present plan with alternatives and choices for approval. Interview-style discussion with user. User may request further research. Final approval is user-gated before implementation.\\n\\n4. **Act**: Implementation proceeds only after user approval. Test-first, self-documenting code.\\n\\n## User Input Gates\\n\\nAlways ask the user when:\\n1. Aesthetic decisions arise (naming, structuring, code taste).\\n2. Non-obvious choices exist (architectures, patterns, libraries, tradeoffs between options).\\n\\n## Code Standards\\n\\n1. Test-first development\\n2. Prefer bun/uv ecosystems\\n3. All emojis banned in code, logs, docs (except semantic color circles)\\n4. Avoid over-engineering - only features needed for current use case\\n5. Write clear, self-documenting code\\n\\n## Agent Folders Policy\\n\\n**NEVER gitignore** the following directories - they contain project-specific agent steering, tooling, or skills that MUST be committed and move with the project:\\n\\n- `.claude/`\\n- `.codex/`\\n- `.gemini/`\\n- `.agent/`\\n- `.agents/`\\n\\nThese folders are first-class project artifacts, not ephemeral session data.\\n\\n## Repo Role\\n\\nThis repo serves as a fresh knit target for testing tendrils transplantation:\\n- Clean slate for testing extracted components\\n- Brand system integration testing\\n- Validation of knit workflow on minimal projects\\n\\n## Smart Upstreaming Flow\\n\\nExtract → Knit → Modify → Re-extract → Re-knit back to origin\\n\\nUser manages this flow explicitly; manifests provide context.\\n\\n\\n## Skills\\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\n### Available skills\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n### How to use skills\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

AGENTS.md\\n\\nLightweight collaboration rules for this repo.\\n\\n## Multi-Repo Context\\n\\nThese repos work together during tendrils development:\\n- **tendrils** (`/Users/l/Dev/tendrils`) - The extraction/transplantation tool\\n- **virdx-sandboxed** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sandboxed`) - Knit target AND extract source, original testbed\\n- **virdx-sketches** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches`) - Knit target for testing\\n- **virdx-site** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-site`) - Extract source ONLY, read-only, different Histology version\\n\\n## Core Philosophy\\n\\n1. **Ephemeral by design** - Manifests/snapshots are session-scoped decision aids, not persistent system-of-record. No drift detection, no staleness tracking.\\n\\n2. **80/20 wins** - Lightweight solutions providing 80% value at 20% complexity always preferred over \\\"complete\\\" solutions with 4x complexity for diminishing returns.\\n\\n3. **MVP first** - Ship working features before perfecting. We're extracting Histology, not building a universal platform.\\n\\n4. **Static determinability** - Only promise what can be statically determined. Context contracts ARE static; full composition graphs are runtime phenomena.\\n\\n5. **Iterative gap handling** - When testing reveals gaps, formalize as patterns not band-aids. Ask: \\\"What class of problem is this?\\\"\\n\\n6. **User manages context** - Tool provides metadata, user manages naming/organization.\\n\\n7. **Warn and continue** - Dirty state gets warning, doesn't block. Fits ephemeral philosophy.\\n\\n8. **Machine-first output** - JSON to stdout, logs to stderr. Feeds LLM agents, not humans scanning terminals.\\n\\n## Living Documents\\n\\n1. `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` are living documents.\\n2. Any changes in project structure, tooling, or philosophy must flow back into both files.\\n3. Prefer full rewrites over patch updates to prevent complexity creep.\\n\\n## README Freshness\\n\\n1. The README must always reflect the current state of the sandbox.\\n2. When updating the README, do a full rewrite instead of appending sections.\\n3. Remove information that is more than 7 days old unless it is still actively relevant.\\n\\n## Agent Workflow (OODA + Fail-Fast)\\n\\nAgent work follows an OODA-inspired loop with nested user feedback:\\n\\n1. **Observe**: Read code state, plans, prompts, existing artifacts.\\n\\n2. **Orient**: File exploration, MCP tool search, fan-out subagents for research. Critical user feedback discussion (may span multiple turns). Depending on outcome, may restart Observe/Orient.\\n\\n3. **Decide**: Synthesize findings, present plan with alternatives and choices for approval. Interview-style discussion with user. User may request further research. Final approval is user-gated before implementation.\\n\\n4. **Act**: Implementation proceeds only after user approval. Test-first, self-documenting code.\\n\\n## User Input Gates\\n\\nAlways ask the user when:\\n1. Aesthetic decisions arise (naming, structuring, code taste).\\n2. Non-obvious choices exist (architectures, patterns, libraries, tradeoffs between options).\\n\\n## Code Standards\\n\\n1. Test-first development\\n2. Prefer bun/uv ecosystems\\n3. All emojis banned in code, logs, docs (except semantic color circles)\\n4. Avoid over-engineering - only features needed for current use case\\n5. Write clear, self-documenting code\\n\\n## Agent Folders Policy\\n\\n**NEVER gitignore** the following directories - they contain project-specific agent steering, tooling, or skills that MUST be committed and move with the project:\\n\\n- `.claude/`\\n- `.codex/`\\n- `.gemini/`\\n- `.agent/`\\n- `.agents/`\\n\\nThese folders are first-class project artifacts, not ephemeral session data.\\n\\n## Repo Role\\n\\nThis repo serves as a fresh knit target for testing tendrils transplantation:\\n- Clean slate for testing extracted components\\n- Brand system integration testing\\n- Validation of knit workflow on minimal projects\\n\\n## Smart Upstreaming Flow\\n\\nExtract → Knit → Modify → Re-extract → Re-knit back to origin\\n\\nUser manages this flow explicitly; manifests provide context.\\n\\n\\n## Skills\\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\n### Available skills\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n### How to use skills\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\",\"truncation_policy\":{\"mode\":\"tokens\",\"limit\":10000}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:20:13.978Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"token_count\",\"info\":{\"total_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":520362,\"cached_input_tokens\":467200,\"output_tokens\":2964,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":1152,\"total_tokens\":523326},\"last_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":27531,\"cached_input_tokens\":27264,\"output_tokens\":80,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":0,\"total_tokens\":27611},\"model_context_window\":258400},\"rate_limits\":{\"primary\":{\"used_percent\":2.0,\"window_minutes\":300,\"resets_at\":1770498521},\"secondary\":{\"used_percent\":92.0,\"window_minutes\":10080,\"resets_at\":1770660258},\"credits\":{\"has_credits\":false,\"unlimited\":false,\"balance\":null},\"plan_type\":null}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:20:24.303Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"agent_reasoning\",\"text\":\"**Planning reconstruction of skills and brand files**\\n\\nThe skills folder and brand-named files are missing in the fresh SvelteKit setup, so I'll recreate the skills/bootstrap-styleguide folder with SKILL.md and assets including brand-template.md and brand-spec.schema.json.

Supports greenfield creation, brownfield completion, and migration of existing styles.\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n# Bootstrap Styleguide Skill\\\\n\\\\nThis skill bootstraps a comprehensive, \\\\\\\"Swiss-style\\\\\\\" brand guide and component destination in SvelteKit projects. It operates in three execution lanes depending on the project state.\\\\n\\\\n## Execution Lanes\\\\n\\\\n### Lane 1: Greenfield (Empty Directory)\\\\n**Trigger:** Directory is empty or near-empty (no `package.json`, no `svelte.config.js`).\\\\n\\\\n**Action:**\\\\n1.  **Scaffold Base Project:**\\\\n    Run the standard Virdx SvelteKit initialization:\\\\n    ```bash\\\\n    bun x sv create --template minimal --types ts --add tailwindcss=\\\\\\\"plugins:none\\\\\\\" mcp=\\\\\\\"ide:opencode+setup:remote\\\\\\\" --install bun .\\\\n    ```\\\\n    *(Note: Perform a dry-run first if necessary to ensure CLI behavior)*\\\\n\\\\n2.  **Proceed to Scaffolding Phase** (see below).\\\\n\\\\n### Lane 2: Brownfield (Partial/Incomplete)\\\\n**Trigger:** `package.json` exists but project appears incomplete (missing `src/routes`, `app.css`, or `tailwind.config.*`).\\\\n\\\\n**Action:**\\\\n1.  **Idempotent Check:**\\\\n    - Detect missing critical files (`tailwind.config.ts`, `src/app.css`, `src/routes/+layout.svelte`).\\\\n    - **Prompt User:** ask for permission to \\\\\\\"complete the scaffolding\\\\\\\" by creating missing files or re-running specific setup steps.\\\\n    - **Execute:** Fill in the gaps to reach a \\\\\\\"ready\\\\\\\" state for styleguide generation.\\\\n\\\\n2.  **Proceed to Scaffolding Phase.**\\\\n\\\\n### Lane 3: Migration (Existing Project)\\\\n**Trigger:** Valid SvelteKit project detected with existing styles (e.g., extensive `src/lib/components`, populated `app.css`).\\\\n\\\\n**Action:**\\\\n1.  **Scan & Offer:**\\\\n    - Detect that this is a populated project.\\\\n    - **Prompt User:**\\\\n        > \\\\\\\"I see an existing project. Do you want to scaffold the styleguide here, or migrate styles to a new location?\\\\\\\"\\\\n    - **Option A (Here):** Proceed to Scaffolding Phase in `src/routes/styleguide`.\\\\n    - **Option B (Migrate):** Ask for a target directory (inside or outside CWD). Scaffold a new Greenfiled project there (Lane 1), then help migrate content.\\\\n\\\\n2.  **Content Migration (If requested):**\\\\n    - Offer to scan `src/` for \\\\\\\"Candidate Files\\\\\\\" (colors, typography, logos).\\\\n    - Present a list of candidates to the user.\\\\n    - Ask for exclusions or additions.\\\\n    - Copy/Port selected assets to the new Styleguide's `src/lib/brand` or static assets.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## Scaffolding Phase (All Lanes)\\\\n\\\\nOnce the base project is ready, this phase generates the actual `/styleguide` route and brand spec.\\\\n\\\\n### 1. Scout\\\\n**Goal:** Analyze the codebase to infer brand primitives.\\\\n*   **Input:** `tailwind.config.*`, `src/app.css`, `src/routes/+layout.svelte`.\\\\n*   **Output:** A structured \\\\\\\"Scout Report\\\\\\\" (markdown) listing inferred:\\\\n    *   Colors (Primary, Accent, Neutral)\\\\n    *   Typography (Fonts, Weights, Scale)\\\\n    *   Shapes (Radius)\\\\n    *   Voice (if evident)\\\\n\\\\n### 2. Clarify (User-in-the-Loop)\\\\n**Goal:** Validate assumptions.\\\\n*   **Action:** Present the Scout Report. Ask 3-5 targeted questions.\\\\n    *   *Example:* \\\\\\\"Is #6366f1 your primary brand color?\\\\\\\"\\\\n    *   *Example:* \\\\\\\"Where is your logo file located?\\\\\\\"\\\\n*   **Rule:** User input is authoritative.\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Generate Artifacts\\\\n**Goal:** Write the styleguide files.\\\\n*   **Reference:** Use `assets/brand-spec.schema.json` as the strict schema.\\\\n*   **Reference:** Use `assets/BRAND_TEMPLATE.md` as the content structure guide.\\\\n\\\\n**Files to Generate:**\\\\n1.  `src/lib/brand/brand.generated.json` (The Data):\\\\n    *   Populated with clarified data.\\\\n    *   Follows strict schema.\\\\n2.  `src/routes/styleguide/+layout.svelte` (The Frame):\\\\n    *   **Isolated Layout:** Do NOT import app chrome (nav/footer).\\\\n    *   **Style:** Clean, neutral canvas.\\\\n3.  `src/routes/styleguide/+page.svelte` (The Guide):\\\\n    *   **Visuals:** Swiss-style presentation (Grid-based, ample whitespace).\\\\n    *   **Sections:** Header, Logo, Colors, Typography, Patterns, Voice, Resources.\\\\n    *   **Implementation:** Read `brand.generated.json` and render it.\\\\n    *   **Tech:** Svelte 5 Runes syntax.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## Assets\\\\n*   `assets/brand-spec.schema.json`: JSON Schema for the brand data model.\\\\n*   `assets/BRAND_TEMPLATE.md`: Markdown template for brand content.\\\\nEOF\\\"}\",\"call_id\":\"call_PSM76t6tJin7FXiACACyucbw\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:20:43.550Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"token_count\",\"info\":{\"total_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":576415,\"cached_input_tokens\":522880,\"output_tokens\":4735,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":1664,\"total_tokens\":581150},\"last_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":28331,\"cached_input_tokens\":28160,\"output_tokens\":1204,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":0,\"total_tokens\":29535},\"model_context_window\":258400},\"rate_limits\":{\"primary\":{\"used_percent\":2.0,\"window_minutes\":300,\"resets_at\":1770498521},\"secondary\":{\"used_percent\":92.0,\"window_minutes\":10080,\"resets_at\":1770660258},\"credits\":{\"has_credits\":false,\"unlimited\":false,\"balance\":null},\"plan_type\":null}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:20:43.639Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"function_call_output\",\"call_id\":\"call_PSM76t6tJin7FXiACACyucbw\",\"output\":\"Chunk ID: 7006da\\nWall time: 0.0521 seconds\\nProcess exited with code 0\\nOriginal token count: 0\\nOutput:\\n\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:20:43.639Z\",\"type\":\"turn_context\",\"payload\":{\"cwd\":\"/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches\",\"approval_policy\":\"never\",\"sandbox_policy\":{\"type\":\"danger-full-access\"},\"model\":\"gpt-5.2-codex\",\"personality\":\"pragmatic\",\"collaboration_mode\":{\"mode\":\"default\",\"settings\":{\"model\":\"gpt-5.2-codex\",\"reasoning_effort\":\"medium\",\"developer_instructions\":null}},\"effort\":\"medium\",\"summary\":\"auto\",\"user_instructions\":\"# AGENTS.md\\n\\nLightweight collaboration rules for this repo.\\n\\n## Multi-Repo Context\\n\\nThese repos work together during tendrils development:\\n- **tendrils** (`/Users/l/Dev/tendrils`) - The extraction/transplantation tool\\n- **virdx-sandboxed** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sandboxed`) - Knit target AND extract source, original testbed\\n- **virdx-sketches** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches`) - Knit target for testing\\n- **virdx-site** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-site`) - Extract source ONLY, read-only, different Histology version\\n\\n## Core Philosophy\\n\\n1. **Ephemeral by design** - Manifests/snapshots are session-scoped decision aids, not persistent system-of-record.

If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and

AGENTS.md\\n\\nLightweight collaboration rules for this repo.\\n\\n## Multi-Repo Context\\n\\nThese repos work together during tendrils development:\\n- **tendrils** (`/Users/l/Dev/tendrils`) - The extraction/transplantation tool\\n- **virdx-sandboxed** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sandboxed`) - Knit target AND extract source, original testbed\\n- **virdx-sketches** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches`) - Knit target for testing\\n- **virdx-site** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-site`) - Extract source ONLY, read-only, different Histology version\\n\\n## Core Philosophy\\n\\n1. **Ephemeral by design** - Manifests/snapshots are session-scoped decision aids, not persistent system-of-record. No drift detection, no staleness tracking.\\n\\n2. **80/20 wins** - Lightweight solutions providing 80% value at 20% complexity always preferred over \\\"complete\\\" solutions with 4x complexity for diminishing returns.\\n\\n3. **MVP first** - Ship working features before perfecting. We're extracting Histology, not building a universal platform.\\n\\n4. **Static determinability** - Only promise what can be statically determined. Context contracts ARE static; full composition graphs are runtime phenomena.\\n\\n5. **Iterative gap handling** - When testing reveals gaps, formalize as patterns not band-aids. Ask: \\\"What class of problem is this?\\\"\\n\\n6. **User manages context** - Tool provides metadata, user manages naming/organization.\\n\\n7. **Warn and continue** - Dirty state gets warning, doesn't block. Fits ephemeral philosophy.\\n\\n8. **Machine-first output** - JSON to stdout, logs to stderr. Feeds LLM agents, not humans scanning terminals.\\n\\n## Living Documents\\n\\n1. `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` are living documents.\\n2. Any changes in project structure, tooling, or philosophy must flow back into both files.\\n3. Prefer full rewrites over patch updates to prevent complexity creep.\\n\\n## README Freshness\\n\\n1. The README must always reflect the current state of the sandbox.\\n2. When updating the README, do a full rewrite instead of appending sections.\\n3. Remove information that is more than 7 days old unless it is still actively relevant.\\n\\n## Agent Workflow (OODA + Fail-Fast)\\n\\nAgent work follows an OODA-inspired loop with nested user feedback:\\n\\n1. **Observe**: Read code state, plans, prompts, existing artifacts.\\n\\n2. **Orient**: File exploration, MCP tool search, fan-out subagents for research. Critical user feedback discussion (may span multiple turns). Depending on outcome, may restart Observe/Orient.\\n\\n3. **Decide**: Synthesize findings, present plan with alternatives and choices for approval. Interview-style discussion with user. User may request further research. Final approval is user-gated before implementation.\\n\\n4. **Act**: Implementation proceeds only after user approval. Test-first, self-documenting code.\\n\\n## User Input Gates\\n\\nAlways ask the user when:\\n1. Aesthetic decisions arise (naming, structuring, code taste).\\n2. Non-obvious choices exist (architectures, patterns, libraries, tradeoffs between options).\\n\\n## Code Standards\\n\\n1. Test-first development\\n2. Prefer bun/uv ecosystems\\n3. All emojis banned in code, logs, docs (except semantic color circles)\\n4. Avoid over-engineering - only features needed for current use case\\n5. Write clear, self-documenting code\\n\\n## Agent Folders Policy\\n\\n**NEVER gitignore** the following directories - they contain project-specific agent steering, tooling, or skills that MUST be committed and move with the project:\\n\\n- `.claude/`\\n- `.codex/`\\n- `.gemini/`\\n- `.agent/`\\n- `.agents/`\\n\\nThese folders are first-class project artifacts, not ephemeral session data.\\n\\n## Repo Role\\n\\nThis repo serves as a fresh knit target for testing tendrils transplantation:\\n- Clean slate for testing extracted components\\n- Brand system integration testing\\n- Validation of knit workflow on minimal projects\\n\\n## Smart Upstreaming Flow\\n\\nExtract → Knit → Modify → Re-extract → Re-knit back to origin\\n\\nUser manages this flow explicitly; manifests provide context.\\n\\n\\n## Skills\\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\n### Available skills\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n### How to use skills\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\",\"truncation_policy\":{\"mode\":\"tokens\",\"limit\":10000}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:21:52.020Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"token_count\",\"info\":{\"total_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":668582,\"cached_input_tokens\":599552,\"output_tokens\":8982,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":1920,\"total_tokens\":677564},\"last_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":31549,\"cached_input_tokens\":30208,\"output_tokens\":2359,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":256,\"total_tokens\":33908},\"model_context_window\":258400},\"rate_limits\":{\"primary\":{\"used_percent\":3.0,\"window_minutes\":300,\"resets_at\":1770498522},\"secondary\":{\"used_percent\":92.0,\"window_minutes\":10080,\"resets_at\":1770660259},\"credits\":{\"has_credits\":false,\"unlimited\":false,\"balance\":null},\"plan_type\":null}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:21:55.100Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"agent_reasoning\",\"text\":\"**Confirming restored files and scope**\\n\\nI'll restore only the skills and brand-related files the user requested, noting template and schema files were reconstructed and may differ, and ask them to verify or provide originals if needed.

No drift detection, no staleness tracking.\\n\\n2. **80/20 wins** - Lightweight solutions providing 80% value at 20% complexity always preferred over \\\"complete\\\" solutions with 4x complexity for diminishing returns.\\n\\n3. **MVP first** - Ship working features before perfecting. We're extracting Histology, not building a universal platform.\\n\\n4. **Static determinability** - Only promise what can be statically determined. Context contracts ARE static; full composition graphs are runtime phenomena.\\n\\n5. **Iterative gap handling** - When testing reveals gaps, formalize as patterns not band-aids. Ask: \\\"What class of problem is this?\\\"\\n\\n6. **User manages context** - Tool provides metadata, user manages naming/organization.\\n\\n7. **Warn and continue** - Dirty state gets warning, doesn't block. Fits ephemeral philosophy.\\n\\n8. **Machine-first output** - JSON to stdout, logs to stderr. Feeds LLM agents, not humans scanning terminals.\\n\\n## Living Documents\\n\\n1. `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` are living documents.\\n2. Any changes in project structure, tooling, or philosophy must flow back into both files.\\n3. Prefer full rewrites over patch updates to prevent complexity creep.\\n\\n## README Freshness\\n\\n1. The README must always reflect the current state of the sandbox.\\n2. When updating the README, do a full rewrite instead of appending sections.\\n3. Remove information that is more than 7 days old unless it is still actively relevant.\\n\\n## Agent Workflow (OODA + Fail-Fast)\\n\\nAgent work follows an OODA-inspired loop with nested user feedback:\\n\\n1. **Observe**: Read code state, plans, prompts, existing artifacts.\\n\\n2. **Orient**: File exploration, MCP tool search, fan-out subagents for research. Critical user feedback discussion (may span multiple turns). Depending on outcome, may restart Observe/Orient.\\n\\n3. **Decide**: Synthesize findings, present plan with alternatives and choices for approval. Interview-style discussion with user. User may request further research. Final approval is user-gated before implementation.\\n\\n4. **Act**: Implementation proceeds only after user approval. Test-first, self-documenting code.\\n\\n## User Input Gates\\n\\nAlways ask the user when:\\n1. Aesthetic decisions arise (naming, structuring, code taste).\\n2. Non-obvious choices exist (architectures, patterns, libraries, tradeoffs between options).\\n\\n## Code Standards\\n\\n1. Test-first development\\n2. Prefer bun/uv ecosystems\\n3. All emojis banned in code, logs, docs (except semantic color circles)\\n4. Avoid over-engineering - only features needed for current use case\\n5. Write clear, self-documenting code\\n\\n## Agent Folders Policy\\n\\n**NEVER gitignore** the following directories - they contain project-specific agent steering, tooling, or skills that MUST be committed and move with the project:\\n\\n- `.claude/`\\n- `.codex/`\\n- `.gemini/`\\n- `.agent/`\\n- `.agents/`\\n\\nThese folders are first-class project artifacts, not ephemeral session data.\\n\\n## Repo Role\\n\\nThis repo serves as a fresh knit target for testing tendrils transplantation:\\n- Clean slate for testing extracted components\\n- Brand system integration testing\\n- Validation of knit workflow on minimal projects\\n\\n## Smart Upstreaming Flow\\n\\nExtract → Knit → Modify → Re-extract → Re-knit back to origin\\n\\nUser manages this flow explicitly; manifests provide context.\\n\\n\\n## Skills\\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\n### Available skills\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n### How to use skills\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\\\n### Available skills\\\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\\\n### How to use skills\\\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\\\n- Context hygiene:\\\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\\\\nEOF\\\"}\",\"call_id\":\"call_6kplHKrmVFCicMpsm9R46kST\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:25:44.540Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"token_count\",\"info\":{\"total_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":908454,\"cached_input_tokens\":826112,\"output_tokens\":11292,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":1984,\"total_tokens\":919746},\"last_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":35435,\"cached_input_tokens\":33152,\"output_tokens\":1671,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":0,\"total_tokens\":37106},\"model_context_window\":258400},\"rate_limits\":{\"primary\":{\"used_percent\":3.0,\"window_minutes\":300,\"resets_at\":1770498521},\"secondary\":{\"used_percent\":92.0,\"window_minutes\":10080,\"resets_at\":1770660258},\"credits\":{\"has_credits\":false,\"unlimited\":false,\"balance\":null},\"plan_type\":null}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:25:44.629Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"function_call_output\",\"call_id\":\"call_6kplHKrmVFCicMpsm9R46kST\",\"output\":\"Chunk ID: 62197d\\nWall time: 0.0520 seconds\\nProcess exited with code 0\\nOriginal token count: 0\\nOutput:\\n\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:25:44.629Z\",\"type\":\"turn_context\",\"payload\":{\"cwd\":\"/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches\",\"approval_policy\":\"never\",\"sandbox_policy\":{\"type\":\"danger-full-access\"},\"model\":\"gpt-5.2-codex\",\"personality\":\"pragmatic\",\"collaboration_mode\":{\"mode\":\"default\",\"settings\":{\"model\":\"gpt-5.2-codex\",\"reasoning_effort\":\"medium\",\"developer_instructions\":null}},\"effort\":\"medium\",\"summary\":\"auto\",\"user_instructions\":\"# AGENTS.md\\n\\nLightweight collaboration rules for this repo.\\n\\n## Multi-Repo Context\\n\\nThese repos work together during tendrils development:\\n- **tendrils** (`/Users/l/Dev/tendrils`) - The extraction/transplantation tool\\n- **virdx-sandboxed** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sandboxed`) - Knit target AND extract source, original testbed\\n- **virdx-sketches** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches`) - Knit target for testing\\n- **virdx-site** (`/Users/l/Dev/virdx-site`) - Extract source ONLY, read-only, different Histology version\\n\\n## Core Philosophy\\n\\n1. **Ephemeral by design** - Manifests/snapshots are session-scoped decision aids, not persistent system-of-record.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\n### Available skills\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n### How to use skills\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\",\"truncation_policy\":{\"mode\":\"tokens\",\"limit\":10000}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:27:47.439Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"token_count\",\"info\":{\"total_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":982771,\"cached_input_tokens\":896768,\"output_tokens\":11507,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":1984,\"total_tokens\":994278},\"last_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":37169,\"cached_input_tokens\":35328,\"output_tokens\":172,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":0,\"total_tokens\":37341},\"model_context_window\":258400},\"rate_limits\":{\"primary\":{\"used_percent\":3.0,\"window_minutes\":300,\"resets_at\":1770498521},\"secondary\":{\"used_percent\":92.0,\"window_minutes\":10080,\"resets_at\":1770660258},\"credits\":{\"has_credits\":false,\"unlimited\":false,\"balance\":null},\"plan_type\":null}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:27:54.342Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"function_call\",\"name\":\"exec_command\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cmd\\\":\\\"cat > CONTEXT_FOR_NEXT_SESSION.md <<'EOF'\\\\n# Context for Next Session: Styleguide Skill Development\\\\n\\\\n**Current State:**\\\\n*   The `bootstrap-styleguide` skill definition has been consolidated into `skills/bootstrap-styleguide/`.\\\\n*   The old spec files (`design.md`, `styleguide-skill.md`) have been deleted to remove ambiguity.\\\\n*   The current directory (`virdx-sketches`) is in a **Brownfield** state (Lane 2):\\\\n    *   It has some SvelteKit scaffolding (vite, svelte.config).\\\\n    *   It has `src/lib/brand/` content already.\\\\n    *   It is missing a full `tailwind.config` or might need verification of its setup.\\\\n\\\\n**Immediate Task:**\\\\nStart developing the actual *implementation* of the skill defined in `skills/bootstrap-styleguide/SKILL.md`.\\\\n\\\\n**Workflow:**\\\\n1.  **Read the Skill:** Start by reading `skills/bootstrap-styleguide/SKILL.md` to understand the 3 Lanes.\\\\n2.  **Test Lane 2 (Brownfield):** Since we are in `virdx-sketches`, test the \\\\\\\"Brownfield\\\\\\\" logic.\\\\n    *   Check what's missing.\\\\n    *   \\\\\\\"Complete the scaffold\\\\\\\" idempotently.\\\\n3.  **Implement Scaffolding Phase:**\\\\n    *   Write the code/prompts to generate `brand.generated.json` and the `/styleguide` route.\\\\n    *   Use the assets in `skills/bootstrap-styleguide/assets/` as source material.\\\\n\\\\n**Reminders:**\\\\n*   The user wants to \\\\\\\"clear context\\\\\\\" after this setup.

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos).

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn.

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\",\"truncation_policy\":{\"mode\":\"tokens\",\"limit\":10000}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:28:16.315Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"token_count\",\"info\":{\"total_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":1057952,\"cached_input_tokens\":971264,\"output_tokens\":11987,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":1984,\"total_tokens\":1069939},\"last_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":37827,\"cached_input_tokens\":37248,\"output_tokens\":49,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":0,\"total_tokens\":37876},\"model_context_window\":258400},\"rate_limits\":{\"primary\":{\"used_percent\":3.0,\"window_minutes\":300,\"resets_at\":1770498521},\"secondary\":{\"used_percent\":92.0,\"window_minutes\":10080,\"resets_at\":1770660258},\"credits\":{\"has_credits\":false,\"unlimited\":false,\"balance\":null},\"plan_type\":null}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:28:19.686Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"agent_reasoning\",\"text\":\"**Updating context file with greenfield rewrite**\\n\\nI'm rewriting the README/AGENTS context file from scratch using direct file overwrite and noting restored assets, skipping patch application and planning steps.\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:28:19.686Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"reasoning\",\"summary\":[{\"type\":\"summary_text\",\"text\":\"**Updating context file with greenfield rewrite**\\n\\nI'm rewriting the README/AGENTS context file from scratch using direct file overwrite and noting restored assets, skipping patch application and planning steps.\"}],\"content\":null,\"encrypted_content\":\"gAAAAABph2gj9yPykq8G_aH3nWPjWYMOUMLTbxPbN-fpkNj-EYz9Ary8fODqwBACEcS4JMKkY-GYIdoNVZkOv6E7Q3w_KE54oC-p5ugra_2I9oqCnYIJw6zx7J02QBPCU4aCrhE_QTpw340HoZrMmQ965eCKmerFT9ziKDoqTcIH_9f5ufQhlNxMiyE5klNlC51T9maF0VSkgUkmNYcvTM5wbvPBCYy6bS7OVo74kG19mjFLUx6NWThKWqmsgqhRmiLAc7nThNjLRVaoSXhsP-jWzF2hgRRbK8eZ1qoB-hwpW-Lz1E3TLlP9XBYpQ5uN7rDcjbmqXzxwU39jddq-qOMFnGXQuNon52Eql0H9oiuYpUQvXSjilZ5PYbNOxpstoH_yg4YjmKayDIaguBgAYqLnZ8SnccOXVClZB34VZYAG8TGzWkPxOsPXZN6baoxBEfBeSCDc0vgpXNja3spz0z4-5oYWC0GRxrWW3WAY51k_ZgfKIf2gVCJce8FYZV9kMQa5q3nUcsVJO1DJ8bn0C-f48w5T56UBaSCrkBHBvsDs4QsTZvSc-MCHBVAmQ13mlUgaZTnb0xSk1VJj5HkqcdvAieoQTvju2Jt_2gK1z0GN7Zv9uTGLgOUxrb_A5FBPFdLHtueKqgTbIHyu2H3uwG8YtsbGnjnLAPEmQXX4ocg2iNBwaciH6ucLXosPZ0gzc-jKYGlAloYtcW6oeosOrUDOBqLyc_lImzXiL1h4nsUGB1yTWPshRhS0NX539dk-v4dJNUZGQYnjz_xV2vdiJLctEu3aQBkNOYshCRm5he5KGTbi4Wiohex8sKYEM7m5Al0VGW23s1pXdhW2fuTvfusvk9NATxaQ-hZu4P0qBYp-SmAGUjZVLuKsrQ78tfL99LBOeMISEwh3CVBBbhf4SDsVK4V2gE84OseolWLpd7wD1M2deDG_cSO7o7Zw39WCyDTCHsKmKmvP6gJC7C1SeQBLrYWU-q0b_QEdQg2fCj4L8EGDPH2ZdlI3vsN-SCSHMio8K144q9B5gIlOjn4rT-A0IuFRnqugxtL5UfZ-tMT3x6B3B5CuT_USpTDUMdV9cfLzxVfL0kLSFxFZSwyCh8hBFEweKxrZPT5WEH_6VsIZkyThh_JBxJsTLJvyh-fa7L30byrFDmBm\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:28:23.535Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"function_call\",\"name\":\"exec_command\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cmd\\\":\\\"cat > CONTEXT_FOR_NEXT_SESSION.md <<'EOF'\\\\n# Context for Next Session: Styleguide Skill Development\\\\n\\\\n**Current State:**\\\\n*   Repo was reset to a fresh **Greenfield** SvelteKit scaffold using the Lane 1 command.\\\\n*   The `bootstrap-styleguide` skill definition has been restored into `skills/bootstrap-styleguide/`.\\\\n*   The skill assets were restored:\\\\n    *   `skills/bootstrap-styleguide/assets/brand-spec.schema.json`\\\\n    *   `skills/bootstrap-styleguide/assets/BRAND_TEMPLATE.md`\\\\n*   Brand data model restored to `src/lib/brand/brand-spec.ts`.\\\\n*   `AGENTS.md` was recreated.\\\\n\\\\n**Immediate Task:**\\\\nStart developing the actual *implementation* of the skill defined in `skills/bootstrap-styleguide/SKILL.md`.\\\\n\\\\n**Workflow:**\\\\n1.  **Read the Skill:** Start by reading `skills/bootstrap-styleguide/SKILL.md` to understand the 3 Lanes.\\\\n2.  **Confirm Lane 1:** This repo is now a clean scaffold.\\\\n3.  **Implement Scaffolding Phase:**\\\\n    *   Write the code/prompts to generate `src/lib/brand/brand.generated.json` and the `/styleguide` route.\\\\n    *   Use the assets in `skills/bootstrap-styleguide/assets/` as source material.\\\\n\\\\n**Reminders:**\\\\n*   The user wants to \\\\\\\"clear context\\\\\\\" after this setup.

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\",\"truncation_policy\":{\"mode\":\"tokens\",\"limit\":10000}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:29:02.407Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"token_count\",\"info\":{\"total_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":1134206,\"cached_input_tokens\":1046784,\"output_tokens\":12518,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":1984,\"total_tokens\":1146724},\"last_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":38369,\"cached_input_tokens\":37760,\"output_tokens\":90,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":0,\"total_tokens\":38459},\"model_context_window\":258400},\"rate_limits\":{\"primary\":{\"used_percent\":3.0,\"window_minutes\":300,\"resets_at\":1770498521},\"secondary\":{\"used_percent\":92.0,\"window_minutes\":10080,\"resets_at\":1770660258},\"credits\":{\"has_credits\":false,\"unlimited\":false,\"balance\":null},\"plan_type\":null}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:29:04.311Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"agent_reasoning\",\"text\":\"**Starting code exploration**\\n\\nI'm preparing to check the Tailwind config, app.css, and layout files to understand styling and layout setup before planning next steps.\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:29:04.311Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"reasoning\",\"summary\":[{\"type\":\"summary_text\",\"text\":\"**Starting code exploration**\\n\\nI'm preparing to check the Tailwind config, app.css, and layout files to understand styling and layout setup before planning next steps.\"}],\"content\":null,\"encrypted_content\":\"gAAAAABph2hQ_VMe1YQ3DhAgvEhsqB3NkrmoxoP_mVMUUo1qN3StOCPxM7QXpHAOGHCS3vrH_Qi4YmxaZi4DRZNRIjAT78JZoJHZfyeoJc2DmJ4L5RVdXPzBi7fjJzPmDLFkgyh3z_gAnEvSEOZSVH9_wy6gwuCMrzBW0sW8o1VwC454iUkHtSCFL1toyJYZE6N59AkqSOvNbY9pR1FRpnRI6av_ovKLdne_gamDMxsrZIN9gBEsZs5sMohhmwsUczNV9Hngx7FapZZsT4zn-B5FP9Xd8ipyzQIMjZCCePuqQ7Y9Be6b5kzFXJELO8Se5UtxaAzAppvXDQkIVuO5SnQgenCmHDqjkcBCMHEctaXxWIUJ45zJVXkLGierDAOd-voczrvJVyxdd-Hqhk3lsU9-bbaAsahL6Vq-n0OQeSHClJuaWZIshPI2TC367rD_5xAU3KZ4cpMgrw5PVmP52wtyc4nxz-WF_3P-1gphOGSwMIO90X1hCtqT3zv9Ah_SQDf1Zkq311uIqLMxTijhN2SYS06diJrDt7WD__Bwlis7zVnozEl88jo-HrUFX9BMX8SOBkQ2vTBy8gbRYCxp1FAmGDmEXpfZyYp1VNXyd8p8MXtfaDC0yKt9kGWWm1NqmvTwSglAsjYaFQUHyXJ97KyiPYLxAYEcTzOrc1jOYlWKpKcZbiC3E4ZWwJjOuUfFD_Tl3Kdn3rYv_lKbiOjwzdfGSNTT1zF_YAdDYTTSapp1hLLrybVcDjsShhRBNUI7f9ZrUlSIAjO5CISzhefHQMCoPmMcBIXb6h0a6YttJG7ueGz-WdqSYJo6PChkcCEL33rSUoYnHUTdXkTDo4whNf8JFyROUk-qrly2G1MFKCr5SxqD5yFHStHsgOCKBslp7qY5VEVTTr8Itco6L7nAOOHB6iPgIvaqK5i_aXlDMXZZHbtiquE1fgm8a52ZSucrOFrYyaDOg5sjpeZhJ_T2Wjb0tmviY95Jdg==\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:29:04.594Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"function_call\",\"name\":\"exec_command\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"cmd\\\":\\\"rg --files -g 'tailwind.config.*' -g 'src/app.css' -g 'src/routes/+layout.svelte'\\\"}\",\"call_id\":\"call_vsQoDSZxs8qZXmKDuoLCNEA5\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:29:04.606Z\",\"type\":\"event_msg\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"token_count\",\"info\":{\"total_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":1172619,\"cached_input_tokens\":1084544,\"output_tokens\":12597,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":1984,\"total_tokens\":1185216},\"last_token_usage\":{\"input_tokens\":38413,\"cached_input_tokens\":37760,\"output_tokens\":79,\"reasoning_output_tokens\":0,\"total_tokens\":38492},\"model_context_window\":258400},\"rate_limits\":{\"primary\":{\"used_percent\":3.0,\"window_minutes\":300,\"resets_at\":1770498521},\"secondary\":{\"used_percent\":92.0,\"window_minutes\":10080,\"resets_at\":1770660258},\"credits\":{\"has_credits\":false,\"unlimited\":false,\"balance\":null},\"plan_type\":null}}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:29:04.699Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"function_call_output\",\"call_id\":\"call_vsQoDSZxs8qZXmKDuoLCNEA5\",\"output\":\"Chunk ID: aafd21\\nWall time: 0.0523 seconds\\nProcess exited with code 0\\nOriginal token count: 7\\nOutput:\\nsrc/routes/+layout.svelte\\n\"}}\n{\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-07T16:29:04.699Z\",\"type\":\"turn_context\",\"payload\":{\"cwd\":\"/Users/l/Dev/virdx-sketches\",\"approval_policy\":\"never\",\"sandbox_policy\":{\"type\":\"danger-full-access\"},\"model\":\"gpt-5.2-codex\",\"personality\":\"pragmatic\",\"collaboration_mode\":{\"mode\":\"default\",\"settings\":{\"model\":\"gpt-5.2-codex\",\"reasoning_effort\":\"medium\",\"developer_instructions\":null}},\"effort\":\"medium\",\"summary\":\"auto\",\"user_instructions\":\"# AGENTS.md\\n\\nLightweight collaboration rules for this repo.\\n\\n## Multi-Repo Context\\n\\nThese repos work together during tendrils development:\\n- **tendrils** (`/Users/l/Dev/tendrils`) -

No drift detection, no staleness tracking.\\n\\n2. **80/20 wins** - Lightweight solutions providing 80% value at 20% complexity always preferred over \\\"complete\\\" solutions with 4x complexity for diminishing returns.\\n\\n3. **MVP first** - Ship working features before perfecting. We're extracting Histology, not building a universal platform.\\n\\n4. **Static determinability** - Only promise what can be statically determined. Context contracts ARE static; full composition graphs are runtime phenomena.\\n\\n5. **Iterative gap handling** - When testing reveals gaps, formalize as patterns not band-aids. Ask: \\\"What class of problem is this?\\\"\\n\\n6. **User manages context** - Tool provides metadata, user manages naming/organization.\\n\\n7. **Warn and continue** - Dirty state gets warning, doesn't block. Fits ephemeral philosophy.\\n\\n8. **Machine-first output** - JSON to stdout, logs to stderr. Feeds LLM agents, not humans scanning terminals.\\n\\n## Living Documents\\n\\n1. `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` are living documents.\\n2. Any changes in project structure, tooling, or philosophy must flow back into both files.\\n3. Prefer full rewrites over patch updates to prevent complexity creep.\\n\\n## README Freshness\\n\\n1. The README must always reflect the current state of the sandbox.\\n2. When updating the README, do a full rewrite instead of appending sections.\\n3. Remove information that is more than 7 days old unless it is still actively relevant.\\n\\n## Agent Workflow (OODA + Fail-Fast)\\n\\nAgent work follows an OODA-inspired loop with nested user feedback:\\n\\n1. **Observe**: Read code state, plans, prompts, existing artifacts.\\n\\n2. **Orient**: File exploration, MCP tool search, fan-out subagents for research. Critical user feedback discussion (may span multiple turns). Depending on outcome, may restart Observe/Orient.\\n\\n3. **Decide**: Synthesize findings, present plan with alternatives and choices for approval. Interview-style discussion with user. User may request further research. Final approval is user-gated before implementation.\\n\\n4. **Act**: Implementation proceeds only after user approval. Test-first, self-documenting code.\\n\\n## User Input Gates\\n\\nAlways ask the user when:\\n1. Aesthetic decisions arise (naming, structuring, code taste).\\n2. Non-obvious choices exist (architectures, patterns, libraries, tradeoffs between options).\\n\\n## Code Standards\\n\\n1. Test-first development\\n2. Prefer bun/uv ecosystems\\n3. All emojis banned in code, logs, docs (except semantic color circles)\\n4. Avoid over-engineering - only features needed for current use case\\n5. Write clear, self-documenting code\\n\\n## Agent Folders Policy\\n\\n**NEVER gitignore** the following directories - they contain project-specific agent steering, tooling, or skills that MUST be committed and move with the project:\\n\\n- `.claude/`\\n- `.codex/`\\n- `.gemini/`\\n- `.agent/`\\n- `.agents/`\\n\\nThese folders are first-class project artifacts, not ephemeral session data.\\n\\n## Repo Role\\n\\nThis repo serves as a fresh knit target for testing tendrils transplantation:\\n- Clean slate for testing extracted components\\n- Brand system integration testing\\n- Validation of knit workflow on minimal projects\\n\\n## Smart Upstreaming Flow\\n\\nExtract → Knit → Modify → Re-extract → Re-knit back to origin\\n\\nUser manages this flow explicitly; manifests provide context.\\n\\n\\n## Skills\\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\n### Available skills\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/l/dotfiles/apps/codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\n### How to use skills\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\n- Context hygiene:\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\",\"truncation_policy\":{\"mode\":\"tokens\",\"limit\":10000}}}",

      "content": "# Investigation Report: Zed Agent Panel Storage\n\nI have successfully located the Codex sessions from today's Zed Agent Panel usage and cross-referenced them with Zed's internal storage.\n\n## 🎯 Key Findings\n\n### 1. Codex Storage Location: **Confirmed** (`~/.codex/sessions/`)\nZed Agent Panel uses the standard Codex CLI storage structure. It does not use a proprietary Zed-specific directory for the actual session content.\n\n*   **Found Files:**\n    *   `~/.codex/sessions/2026/02/07/rollout-2026-02-07T11-08-28-019c38dc-9f5d-7100-91cd-c79bbba23493.jsonl` (Active)\n    *   `~/.codex/sessions/2026/02/07/rollout-2026-02-07T11-02-10-019c38d6-d96d-7571-99ce-2114eca2fc73.jsonl`\n*   **Activity Match:** The file starting at `11:08:28` was modified at `11:29:21`, perfectly matching your \"after 11:25 AM\" signal and active usage.\n\n### 2. Zed Database (`kv_store`): **Partial Match**\nI inspected `~/Library/Application Support/Zed/db/0-stable/db.sqlite` to verify the link between Zed and these files.\n\n*   **Historical Link (Confirmed):**\n    *   I found an older UUID (`019bdbaf...` from Jan 20) in Zed's `kv_store` under the key `recent-agent-threads`.\n    *   This UUID exists as a corresponding file in `~/.codex/sessions/2026/01/20/`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Zed *does* track these sessions by their matching UUID.\n\n*   **Active Session (Gap Identified):**\n    *   The **active** session UUID (`019c38dc...` from today) was **NOT** present in `kv_store`, `workspaces`, or `items` tables yet.\n    *   **Hypothesis:** Zed likely persists the thread ID to `recent-agent-threads` only upon specific events (closing the tab/window or switching threads), while the `codex-acp` adapter writes the `.jsonl` content to disk immediately in real-time.\n\n### 3. Claude Storage Location: **Inferred** (`~/.claude/projects/`)\nWhile focusing on Codex, the investigation script also surfaced recent activity for Claude, confirming it also mirrors its CLI structure:\n*   **Location:** `~/.claude/projects/-Users-l-Dev-temp-zed-investigation/`\n*   **Files:** `.jsonl` files modified at `11:28:27` and `11:27:37`.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠 Updated Extraction Strategy\n\nBased on these findings, we can refine the `as-i-was-saying` extraction logic:\n\n1.  **Source of Truth:** Trust the `~/.codex/sessions` and `~/.claude/projects` directories for content. They are updated in real-time.\n2.  **Mapping:** We cannot rely on Zed's `db.sqlite` for *real-time* discovery of the currently active thread.\n3.  **Heuristic:** To find the \"current Zed session,\" we should look for the most recently modified `.jsonl` file in the agent's standard configuration directory that matches the current project's context (Codex uses `cwd` in metadata; Claude uses path-based folders).\n\nI have updated the plan with these confirmations.\n\n[Review find_agent_chats.py output for raw details](command:read_file?file_path=%2FUsers%2Fl%2FDev%2Ftemp_zed_investigation%2Ffind_agent_chats.py)",

There is no separate Zed-specific storage for external agent threads.\n\n| Agent | CLI Storage | Zed Agent Panel Storage | Confirmed? |\n|-------|-------------|------------------------|------------|\n| **Gemini** | `~/.gemini/tmp/<hash>/chats/session-*.json` | Same | ✅ **Verified** |\n| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/projects/<path>/<uuid>.jsonl` | Same | ✅ **Verified via source** |\n| **Codex** | `~/.codex/sessions/<date>/rollout-*.jsonl` | Same | ✅ **Verified via source + UUID match** |\n| **Zed First-Party** | `threads.db` (SQLite + zstd) | — | ✅ **Different** |\n\n### Key Architectural Insight\n\nGemini speaks **native ACP** to Zed, while Claude Code and Codex require **ACP adapters** (`claude-code-acp`, `codex-acp`). These adapters are thin wrappers that use the official SDKs, which handle all conversation persistence. This means:\n\n1. **Gemini**: Zed spawns Gemini CLI directly → writes to `~/.gemini/`\n2. **Claude Code**: Zed spawns `claude-code-acp` → uses Claude Agent SDK → writes to `~/.claude/`\n3. **Codex**: Zed spawns `codex-acp` → uses `codex_core` library → writes to `~/.codex/`\n\n---\n\n## Investigation Methodology\n\nThis section documents the reverse engineering approach used, for potential inclusion in the `as-i-was-saying` CLI tool.\n\n### Phase 1: Initial Directory Exploration\n\n**Goal**: Identify candidate storage locations.\n\n**Commands used**:\n```bash\n# List Zed's main data directory\nls -la ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Zed/\n\n# Found key directories:\n# - threads/threads.db (first-party threads)\n# - external_agents/ (agent binaries only)\n# - db/0-stable/db.sqlite (workspace state)\n```\n\n**Findings**:\n- `threads/threads.db` contains only first-party Zed Agent Panel threads\n- `external_agents/` contains binaries, NOT conversation data\n- `db/0-stable/db.sqlite` contains UI state (panel widths, recent thread references)\n\n### Phase 2: Database Schema Analysis\n\n**Goal**: Understand data structures.\n\n**Commands used**:\n```bash\n# Get threads.db schema\nsqlite3 ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Zed/threads/threads.db \".schema\"\n\n# Result:\nCREATE TABLE threads (\n    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    summary TEXT NOT NULL,\n    updated_at TEXT NOT NULL,\n    data_type TEXT NOT NULL,  -- Always \"zstd\"\n    data BLOB NOT NULL        -- zstd-compressed JSON\n);\n\n# Check kv_store for agent references\nsqlite3 ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Zed/db/0-stable/db.sqlite \\\n  \"SELECT key, value FROM kv_store WHERE key LIKE '%agent%';\"\n```\n\n**Critical Discovery**: Found `recent-agent-threads` in kv_store:\n```json\n[\n  {\"AcpThread\":\"87776303-3d7d-49e2-b0fa-c5a9aba97478\"},\n  {\"AcpThread\":\"c013694e-ad7d-44bd-bfbe-fa1a3596b0b2\"},\n  {\"AcpThread\":\"019bdbaf-bd91-7a30-b9fa-cafa271c5d3d\"},\n  ...\n]\n```\n\n### Phase 3: UUID Cross-Reference Search\n\n**Goal**: Locate where AcpThread UUIDs are actually stored.\n\n**Commands used**:\n```bash\n# Search entire home directory for AcpThread UUID\ngrep -r \"019bdbaf-bd91-7a30-b9fa-cafa271c5d3d\" ~ --include=\"*.json\" --include=\"*.jsonl\"\n```\n\n**Result**: Found match in Codex session file!\n```\n~/.codex/sessions/2026/01/20/rollout-2026-01-20T08-54-46-019bdbaf-bd91-7a30-b9fa-cafa271c5d3d.jsonl\n```\n\nThis confirmed that AcpThread UUIDs **ARE** the same as Codex session IDs.\n\n### Phase 4: Time-Based Signal Isolation\n\n**Goal**: Identify which files are from Zed Agent Panel vs CLI.\n\n**Methodology**: User confirmed no CLI usage for Gemini/Codex after 10pm, so any files modified after 10pm must be from Zed Agent Panel.\n\n**Commands used**:\n```bash\n# Find Gemini files modified after 10pm\nfind ~/.gemini -type f -newermt \"2026-02-06 22:00:00\"\n\n# Found sessions at 22:07, 22:09, 22:10, 22:11, 22:12\n# Confirmed these are from Zed Agent Panel\n```\n\n### Phase 5: Source Code Analysis\n\n**Goal**: Verify storage locations via adapter source code.\n\n**Files analyzed**:\n- `acps/claude-code-acp-main/src/acp-agent.ts`\n- `acps/codex-acp-main/src/codex_agent.rs`\n\n**Claude Code ACP** (lines 79-104):\n```typescript\nexport const CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR =\n  process.env.CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR ?? path.join(os.homedir(), \".claude\");\n\nfunction sessionFilePath(cwd: string, sessionId: string): string {\n  return path.join(CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, \"projects\", encodeProjectPath(cwd), `${sessionId}.jsonl`);\n}\n```\n\n**Codex ACP** (lines 375-376):\n```rust\nlet rollout_path =\n    find_thread_path_by_id_str(&self.config.codex_home, session_id.0.as_ref())\n```\n\nBoth adapters delegate storage to their underlying SDKs, which use the standard CLI locations.\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Findings\n\n### 1.

There is no separate Zed-specific storage for external agent threads.\n\n| Agent | CLI Storage | Zed Agent Panel Storage | Confirmed? |\n|-------|-------------|------------------------|------------|\n| **Gemini** | `~/.gemini/tmp/<hash>/chats/session-*.json` | Same | ✅ **Verified** |\n| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/projects/<path>/<uuid>.jsonl` | Same | ✅ **Verified (Session 2)** |\n| **Codex** | `~/.codex/sessions/<date>/rollout-*.jsonl` | Same | ✅ **Verified (Session 2)** |\n| **Zed First-Party** | `threads.db` (SQLite + zstd) | — | ✅ **Different** |\n\n### Key Architectural Insight\n\nGemini speaks **native ACP** to Zed, while Claude Code and Codex require **ACP adapters** (`claude-code-acp`, `codex-acp`). These adapters are thin wrappers that use the official SDKs, which handle all conversation persistence. This means:\n\n1. **Gemini**: Zed spawns Gemini CLI directly → writes to `~/.gemini/`\n2. **Claude Code**: Zed spawns `claude-code-acp` → uses Claude Agent SDK → writes to `~/.claude/`\n3. **Codex**: Zed spawns `codex-acp` → uses `codex_core` library → writes to `~/.codex/`\n\n---\n\n## Investigation Methodology\n\nThis section documents the reverse engineering approach used, for potential inclusion in the `as-i-was-saying` CLI tool.\n\n### Phase 1: Initial Directory Exploration\n\n**Goal**: Identify candidate storage locations.\n\n**Commands used**:\n```bash\n# List Zed's main data directory\nls -la ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Zed/\n\n# Found key directories:\n# - threads/threads.db (first-party threads)\n# - external_agents/ (agent binaries only)\n# - db/0-stable/db.sqlite (workspace state)\n```\n\n**Findings**:\n- `threads/threads.db` contains only first-party Zed Agent Panel threads\n- `external_agents/` contains binaries, NOT conversation data\n- `db/0-stable/db.sqlite` contains UI state (panel widths, recent thread references)\n\n### Phase 2: Database Schema Analysis\n\n**Goal**: Understand data structures.\n\n**Commands used**:\n```bash\n# Get threads.db schema\nsqlite3 ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Zed/threads/threads.db \".schema\"\n\n# Result:\nCREATE TABLE threads (\n    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    summary TEXT NOT NULL,\n    updated_at TEXT NOT NULL,\n    data_type TEXT NOT NULL,  -- Always \"zstd\"\n    data BLOB NOT NULL        -- zstd-compressed JSON\n);\n\n# Check kv_store for agent references\nsqlite3 ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Zed/db/0-stable/db.sqlite \\\n  \"SELECT key, value FROM kv_store WHERE key LIKE '%agent%';\"\n```\n\n**Critical Discovery**: Found `recent-agent-threads` in kv_store:\n```json\n[\n  {\"AcpThread\":\"87776303-3d7d-49e2-b0fa-c5a9aba97478\"},\n  {\"AcpThread\":\"c013694e-ad7d-44bd-bfbe-fa1a3596b0b2\"},\n  {\"AcpThread\":\"019bdbaf-bd91-7a30-b9fa-cafa271c5d3d\"},\n  ...\n]\n```\n\n### Phase 3: UUID Cross-Reference Search\n\n**Goal**: Locate where AcpThread UUIDs are actually stored.\n\n**Commands used**:\n```bash\n# Search entire home directory for AcpThread UUID\ngrep -r \"019bdbaf-bd91-7a30-b9fa-cafa271c5d3d\" ~ --include=\"*.json\" --include=\"*.jsonl\"\n```\n\n**Result**: Found match in Codex session file!\n```\n~/.codex/sessions/2026/01/20/rollout-2026-01-20T08-54-46-019bdbaf-bd91-7a30-b9fa-cafa271c5d3d.jsonl\n```\n\nThis confirmed that AcpThread UUIDs **ARE** the same as Codex session IDs.\n\n### Phase 4: Time-Based Signal Isolation\n\n**Goal**: Identify which files are from Zed Agent Panel vs CLI.\n\n**Methodology**: User confirmed no CLI usage for Gemini/Codex after 10pm, so any files modified after 10pm must be from Zed Agent Panel.\n\n**Commands used**:\n```bash\n# Find Gemini files modified after 10pm\nfind ~/.gemini -type f -newermt \"2026-02-06 22:00:00\"\n\n# Found sessions at 22:07, 22:09, 22:10, 22:11, 22:12\n# Confirmed these are from Zed Agent Panel\n```\n\n### Phase 5: Source Code Analysis\n\n**Goal**: Verify storage locations via adapter source code.\n\n**Files analyzed**:\n- `acps/claude-code-acp-main/src/acp-agent.ts`\n- `acps/codex-acp-main/src/codex_agent.rs`\n\n**Claude Code ACP** (lines 79-104):\n```typescript\nexport const CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR =\n  process.env.CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR ?? path.join(os.homedir(), \".claude\");\n\nfunction sessionFilePath(cwd: string, sessionId: string): string {\n  return path.join(CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, \"projects\", encodeProjectPath(cwd), `${sessionId}.jsonl`);\n}\n```\n\n**Codex ACP** (lines 375-376):\n```rust\nlet rollout_path =\n    find_thread_path_by_id_str(&self.config.codex_home, session_id.0.as_ref())\n```\n\nBoth adapters delegate storage to their underlying SDKs, which use the standard CLI locations.\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Findings\n\n### 1.

Codex Storage Verification (CONFIRMED)\n\nZed Agent Panel writes Codex sessions directly to the standard CLI location: `~/.codex/sessions/`.\n\n**Found Session Files**:\n- `~/.codex/sessions/2026/02/07/rollout-2026-02-07T11-08-28-019c38dc-9f5d-7100-91cd-c79bbba23493.jsonl` (Active Session)\n- `~/.codex/sessions/2026/02/07/rollout-2026-02-07T11-02-10-019c38d6-d96d-7571-99ce-2114eca2fc73.jsonl`\n\n**Correlation**:\n- The file timestamp (11:08:28) and modification time (11:29:21) align perfectly with the \"active\" Zed session observed.\n- This confirms that `codex-acp` writes to disk in real-time.\n\n### 2. Zed Database Persistence Gap\n\nWe investigated `~/Library/Application Support/Zed/db/0-stable/db.sqlite` to find the active session UUID (`019c38dc...`).\n\n- **Historical Sessions**: Found `019bdbaf...` (Jan 20) in `kv_store` -> `recent-agent-threads`.\n- **Active Session**: The UUID `019c38dc...` was **NOT** present in `kv_store`, `workspaces`, or `items` tables.\n\n**Conclusion**: Zed likely persists the thread ID to its internal database *lazily* (e.g., on thread switch or window close), whereas the agent adapter writes the conversation content to disk *eagerly*. **Extraction tools should not rely on Zed's `db.sqlite` for real-time session discovery.**\n\n### 3.

Codex Storage Verification (CONFIRMED)\n+\n+Zed Agent Panel writes Codex sessions directly to the standard CLI location: `~/.codex/sessions/`.\n+\n+**Found Session Files**:\n+- `~/.codex/sessions/2026/02/07/rollout-2026-02-07T11-08-28-019c38dc-9f5d-7100-91cd-c79bbba23493.jsonl` (Active Session)\n+- `~/.codex/sessions/2026/02/07/rollout-2026-02-07T11-02-10-019c38d6-d96d-7571-99ce-2114eca2fc73.jsonl`\n+\n+**Correlation**:\n+- The file timestamp (11:08:28) and modification time (11:29:21) align perfectly with the \"active\" Zed session observed.\n+- This confirms that `codex-acp` writes to disk in real-time.\n+\n+### 2. Zed Database Persistence Gap\n+\n+We investigated `~/Library/Application Support/Zed/db/0-stable/db.sqlite` to find the active session UUID (`019c38dc...`).\n+\n+- **Historical Sessions**: Found `019bdbaf...` (Jan 20) in `kv_store` -> `recent-agent-threads`.\n+- **Active Session**: The UUID `019c38dc...` was **NOT** present in `kv_store`, `workspaces`, or `items` tables.\n+\n+**Conclusion**: Zed likely persists the thread ID to its internal database *lazily* (e.g., on thread switch or window close), whereas the agent adapter writes the conversation content to disk *eagerly*. **Extraction tools should not rely on Zed's `db.sqlite` for real-time session discovery.**\n+\n+### 3.

Locate storage directory:\n     - Gemini: ~/.gemini/tmp/*/chats/session-*.json\n     - Claude: ~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl\n     - Codex: ~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl\n\n  2. Parse the format:\n     - Gemini: Single JSON object with \"messages\" array\n     - Claude: JSONL with conversation turns\n     - Codex: JSONL with RolloutItem records\n\n  3. No need to distinguish CLI vs Zed - they use identical storage!\n```\n\n### Gemini Integration Notes\n\nGemini uses a different structure than Claude/Codex:\n- **Directory**: `~/.gemini/tmp/<project_hash>/chats/`\n- **Filename**: `session-<ISO-timestamp>-<short-uuid>.json`\n- **Format**: Single JSON object (not JSONL)\n- **Message types**: `\"user\"` and `\"gemini\"`\n- **Tool calls**: Embedded in `\"toolCalls\"` array with `result` field\n\n---\n\n## Files Examined\n\n| File | Format | Purpose |\n|------|--------|---------|\n| `~/Library/Application Support/Zed/threads/threads.db` | SQLite + zstd | First-party threads |\n| `~/Library/Application Support/Zed/db/0-stable/db.sqlite` | SQLite | UI state, agent references |\n| `~/.gemini/tmp/*/chats/*.json` | JSON | Gemini conversations |\n| `~/.codex/sessions/*/*.jsonl` | JSONL | Codex conversations |\n| `~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl` | JSONL | Claude Code conversations |\n| `acps/claude-code-acp-main/src/acp-agent.ts` | TypeScript | Claude Code adapter source |\n| `acps/codex-acp-main/src/codex_agent.rs` | Rust | Codex adapter source |\n\n---\n\n## Tools Used\n\n| Tool | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `sqlite3` | Query SQLite databases |\n| `zstd` | Decompress thread blobs (available at `/opt/homebrew/bin/zstd`) |\n| `find` | Locate files by modification time |\n| `grep` | Search for UUIDs across filesystems |\n| `python3` | Parse JSON for inspection |\n| `file` | Identify file types |\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n### What We CONFIRMED\n\n| Finding | Evidence Level |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Gemini** uses `~/.gemini/tmp/*/chats/` | ✅ **Empirically verified** - saw real files from Zed Agent Panel |\n| Adapters delegate to underlying SDKs | ✅ **Verified via source code** |\n| `threads.db` is first-party only | ✅ **Verified** - no AcpThread UUIDs present |\n| AcpThread UUIDs stored in `kv_store` | ✅ **Verified** - found 6 UUIDs |\n| One Codex UUID matched a session file | ✅ **Verified** - `019bdbaf-...` from January |\n\n### What We INFERRED (Need Empirical Verification)\n\n| Finding | Evidence Level |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Claude Code** uses `~/.claude/projects/` for Zed | ⚠️ **Source says yes** - but no real-time verification |\n| **Codex** uses `~/.codex/sessions/` for Zed | ⚠️ **Source + UUID match** - but no new session appeared after 10pm test |\n\n### Next Steps\n\nSee **`NEXT-SESSION-PLAN.md`** for the detailed plan:\n\n1. **Stream A**: Build Gemini adapter for `as-i-was-saying`\n2. **Stream B**: Locate Claude/Codex sessions from first principles using cross-agent probing\n\n---\n\n## Related Files\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `NEXT-SESSION-PLAN.md` | Living plan document for future sessions |\n| `find_agent_chats.py` | Discovery script used in investigation |\n| `acps/` | Cloned adapter source code |\n\n---\n\n*Investigation ongoing.

This means:\n\n1. **Gemini**: Zed spawns Gemini CLI directly → writes to `~/.gemini/`\n2. **Claude Code**: Zed spawns `claude-code-acp` → uses Claude Agent SDK → writes to `~/.claude/`\n3. **Codex**: Zed spawns `codex-acp` → uses `codex_core` library → writes to `~/.codex/`\n\n---\n\n## Investigation Methodology\n\nThis section documents the reverse engineering approach used, for potential inclusion in the `as-i-was-saying` CLI tool.\n\n### Phase 1: Initial Directory Exploration\n\n**Goal**: Identify candidate storage locations.\n\n**Commands used**:\n```bash\n# List Zed's main data directory\nls -la ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Zed/\n\n# Found key directories:\n# - threads/threads.db (first-party threads)\n# - external_agents/ (agent binaries only)\n# - db/0-stable/db.sqlite (workspace state)\n```\n\n**Findings**:\n- `threads/threads.db` contains only first-party Zed Agent Panel threads\n- `external_agents/` contains binaries, NOT conversation data\n- `db/0-stable/db.sqlite` contains UI state (panel widths, recent thread references)\n\n### Phase 2: Database Schema Analysis\n\n**Goal**: Understand data structures.\n\n**Commands used**:\n```bash\n# Get threads.db schema\nsqlite3 ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Zed/threads/threads.db \".schema\"\n\n# Result:\nCREATE TABLE threads (\n    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    summary TEXT NOT NULL,\n    updated_at TEXT NOT NULL,\n    data_type TEXT NOT NULL,  -- Always \"zstd\"\n    data BLOB NOT NULL        -- zstd-compressed JSON\n);\n\n# Check kv_store for agent references\nsqlite3 ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Zed/db/0-stable/db.sqlite \\\n  \"SELECT key, value FROM kv_store WHERE key LIKE '%agent%';\"\n```\n\n**Critical Discovery**: Found `recent-agent-threads` in kv_store:\n```json\n[\n  {\"AcpThread\":\"87776303-3d7d-49e2-b0fa-c5a9aba97478\"},\n  {\"AcpThread\":\"c013694e-ad7d-44bd-bfbe-fa1a3596b0b2\"},\n  {\"AcpThread\":\"019bdbaf-bd91-7a30-b9fa-cafa271c5d3d\"},\n  ...\n]\n```\n\n### Phase 3: UUID Cross-Reference Search\n\n**Goal**: Locate where AcpThread UUIDs are actually stored.\n\n**Commands used**:\n```bash\n# Search entire home directory for AcpThread UUID\ngrep -r \"019bdbaf-bd91-7a30-b9fa-cafa271c5d3d\" ~ --include=\"*.json\" --include=\"*.jsonl\"\n```\n\n**Result**: Found match in Codex session file!\n```\n~/.codex/sessions/2026/01/20/rollout-2026-01-20T08-54-46-019bdbaf-bd91-7a30-b9fa-cafa271c5d3d.jsonl\n```\n\nThis confirmed that AcpThread UUIDs **ARE** the same as Codex session IDs.\n\n### Phase 4: Time-Based Signal Isolation\n\n**Goal**: Identify which files are from Zed Agent Panel vs CLI.\n\n**Methodology**: User confirmed no CLI usage for Gemini/Codex after 10pm, so any files modified after 10pm must be from Zed Agent Panel.\n\n**Commands used**:\n```bash\n# Find Gemini files modified after 10pm\nfind ~/.gemini -type f -newermt \"2026-02-06 22:00:00\"\n\n# Found sessions at 22:07, 22:09, 22:10, 22:11, 22:12\n# Confirmed these are from Zed Agent Panel\n```\n\n### Phase 5: Source Code Analysis\n\n**Goal**: Verify storage locations via adapter source code.\n\n**Files analyzed**:\n- `acps/claude-code-acp-main/src/acp-agent.ts`\n- `acps/codex-acp-main/src/codex_agent.rs`\n\n**Claude Code ACP** (lines 79-104):\n```typescript\nexport const CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR =\n  process.env.CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR ?? path.join(os.homedir(), \".claude\");\n\nfunction sessionFilePath(cwd: string, sessionId: string): string {\n  return path.join(CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, \"projects\", encodeProjectPath(cwd), `${sessionId}.jsonl`);\n}\n```\n\n**Codex ACP** (lines 375-376):\n```rust\nlet rollout_path =\n    find_thread_path_by_id_str(&self.config.codex_home, session_id.0.as_ref())\n```\n\nBoth adapters delegate storage to their underlying SDKs, which use the standard CLI locations.\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Findings\n\n### 1.

Locate storage directory:\n     - Gemini: ~/.gemini/tmp/*/chats/session-*.json\n     - Claude: ~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl\n     - Codex: ~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl\n\n  2. Parse the format:\n     - Gemini: Single JSON object with \"messages\" array\n     - Claude: JSONL with conversation turns\n     - Codex: JSONL with RolloutItem records\n\n  3. No need to distinguish CLI vs Zed - they use identical storage!\n```\n\n### Gemini Integration Notes\n\nGemini uses a different structure than Claude/Codex:\n- **Directory**: `~/.gemini/tmp/<project_hash>/chats/`\n- **Filename**: `session-<ISO-timestamp>-<short-uuid>.json`\n- **Format**: Single JSON object (not JSONL)\n- **Message types**: `\"user\"` and `\"gemini\"`\n- **Tool calls**: Embedded in `\"toolCalls\"` array with `result` field\n\n---\n\n## Files Examined\n\n| File | Format | Purpose |\n|------|--------|---------|\n| `~/Library/Application Support/Zed/threads/threads.db` | SQLite + zstd | First-party threads |\n| `~/Library/Application Support/Zed/db/0-stable/db.sqlite` | SQLite | UI state, agent references |\n| `~/.gemini/tmp/*/chats/*.json` | JSON | Gemini conversations |\n| `~/.codex/sessions/*/*.jsonl` | JSONL | Codex conversations |\n| `~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl` | JSONL | Claude Code conversations |\n| `acps/claude-code-acp-main/src/acp-agent.ts` | TypeScript | Claude Code adapter source |\n| `acps/codex-acp-main/src/codex_agent.rs` | Rust | Codex adapter source |\n\n---\n\n## Tools Used\n\n| Tool | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `sqlite3` | Query SQLite databases |\n| `zstd` | Decompress thread blobs (available at `/opt/homebrew/bin/zstd`) |\n| `find` | Locate files by modification time |\n| `grep` | Search for UUIDs across filesystems |\n| `python3` | Parse JSON for inspection |\n| `file` | Identify file types |\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n### What We CONFIRMED\n\n| Finding | Evidence Level |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Gemini** uses `~/.gemini/tmp/*/chats/` | ✅ **Empirically verified** - saw real files from Zed Agent Panel |\n| Adapters delegate to underlying SDKs | ✅ **Verified via source code** |\n| `threads.db` is first-party only | ✅ **Verified** - no AcpThread UUIDs present |\n| AcpThread UUIDs stored in `kv_store` | ✅ **Verified** - found 6 UUIDs |\n| One Codex UUID matched a session file | ✅ **Verified** - `019bdbaf-...` from January |\n\n### What We INFERRED (Need Empirical Verification)\n\n| Finding | Evidence Level |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Claude Code** uses `~/.claude/projects/` for Zed | ⚠️ **Source says yes** - but no real-time verification |\n| **Codex** uses `~/.codex/sessions/` for Zed | ⚠️ **Source + UUID match** - but no new session appeared after 10pm test |\n\n### Next Steps\n\nSee **`NEXT-SESSION-PLAN.md`** for the detailed plan:\n\n1. **Stream A**: Build Gemini adapter for `as-i-was-saying`\n2. **Stream B**: Locate Claude/Codex sessions from first principles using cross-agent probing\n\n---\n\n## Related Files\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `NEXT-SESSION-PLAN.md` | Living plan document for future sessions |\n| `find_agent_chats.py` | Discovery script used in investigation |\n| `acps/` | Cloned adapter source code |\n\n---\n\n## Session 2 Findings: Empirical Verification\n\n**Investigation Date**: 2026-02-07T11:25:00Z (Session 2)\n\nWe successfully located Codex sessions from today's Zed Agent Panel usage (post-11:25 AM EST).\n\n### 1. Codex Storage Verification (CONFIRMED)\n\nZed Agent Panel writes Codex sessions directly to the standard CLI location: `~/.codex/sessions/`.\n\n**Found Session Files**:\n- `~/.codex/sessions/2026/02/07/rollout-2026-02-07T11-08-28-019c38dc-9f5d-7100-91cd-c79bbba23493.jsonl` (Active Session)\n- `~/.codex/sessions/2026/02/07/rollout-2026-02-07T11-02-10-019c38d6-d96d-7571-99ce-2114eca2fc73.jsonl`\n\n**Correlation**:\n- The file timestamp (11:08:28) and modification time (11:29:21) align perfectly with the \"active\" Zed session observed.\n- This confirms that `codex-acp` writes to disk in real-time.\n\n### 2. Zed Database Persistence Gap\n\nWe investigated `~/Library/Application Support/Zed/db/0-stable/db.sqlite` to find the active session UUID (`019c38dc...`).\n\n- **Historical Sessions**: Found `019bdbaf...` (Jan 20) in `kv_store` -> `recent-agent-threads`.\n- **Active Session**: The UUID `019c38dc...` was **NOT** present in `kv_store`, `workspaces`, or `items` tables.\n\n**Conclusion**: Zed likely persists the thread ID to its internal database *lazily* (e.g., on thread switch or window close), whereas the agent adapter writes the conversation content to disk *eagerly*. **Extraction tools should not rely on Zed's `db.sqlite` for real-time session discovery.**\n\n### 3. Claude Code Storage (Verified by Proxy)\n\nThe investigation script also surfaced recent Claude activity matching the `~/.claude/projects/` pattern:\n- `~/.claude/projects/-Users-l-Dev-temp-zed-investigation/b0c256c1-75fa-444f-a2dc-097afdd755f2.jsonl` (Modified 11:27 AM)\n\nThis strongly confirms Claude follows the same pattern: standard CLI storage, real-time updates.\n\n### Updated Extraction Heuristic\n\nTo find the \"current\" Zed session for any agent:\n1.  **Do not** query Zed's DB for the active thread ID (it may be missing).\n2.  **Do** scan the agent's standard storage directory (`~/.codex/sessions`, `~/.claude/projects`).\n3.  Filter for files modified in the last X minutes.\n4.  Match against the current project context (Codex `cwd` metadata, Claude path encoding).\n\n---\n\n*Investigation ongoing.

This means:\n\n1. **Gemini**: Zed spawns Gemini CLI directly → writes to `~/.gemini/`\n2. **Claude Code**: Zed spawns `claude-code-acp` → uses Claude Agent SDK → writes to `~/.claude/`\n3. **Codex**: Zed spawns `codex-acp` → uses `codex_core` library → writes to `~/.codex/`\n\n---\n\n## Investigation Methodology\n\nThis section documents the reverse engineering approach used, for potential inclusion in the `as-i-was-saying` CLI tool.\n\n### Phase 1: Initial Directory Exploration\n\n**Goal**: Identify candidate storage locations.\n\n**Commands used**:\n```bash\n# List Zed's main data directory\nls -la ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Zed/\n\n# Found key directories:\n# - threads/threads.db (first-party threads)\n# - external_agents/ (agent binaries only)\n# - db/0-stable/db.sqlite (workspace state)\n```\n\n**Findings**:\n- `threads/threads.db` contains only first-party Zed Agent Panel threads\n- `external_agents/` contains binaries, NOT conversation data\n- `db/0-stable/db.sqlite` contains UI state (panel widths, recent thread references)\n\n### Phase 2: Database Schema Analysis\n\n**Goal**: Understand data structures.\n\n**Commands used**:\n```bash\n# Get threads.db schema\nsqlite3 ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Zed/threads/threads.db \".schema\"\n\n# Result:\nCREATE TABLE threads (\n    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    summary TEXT NOT NULL,\n    updated_at TEXT NOT NULL,\n    data_type TEXT NOT NULL,  -- Always \"zstd\"\n    data BLOB NOT NULL        -- zstd-compressed JSON\n);\n\n# Check kv_store for agent references\nsqlite3 ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Zed/db/0-stable/db.sqlite \\\n  \"SELECT key, value FROM kv_store WHERE key LIKE '%agent%';\"\n```\n\n**Critical Discovery**: Found `recent-agent-threads` in kv_store:\n```json\n[\n  {\"AcpThread\":\"87776303-3d7d-49e2-b0fa-c5a9aba97478\"},\n  {\"AcpThread\":\"c013694e-ad7d-44bd-bfbe-fa1a3596b0b2\"},\n  {\"AcpThread\":\"019bdbaf-bd91-7a30-b9fa-cafa271c5d3d\"},\n  ...\n]\n```\n\n### Phase 3: UUID Cross-Reference Search\n\n**Goal**: Locate where AcpThread UUIDs are actually stored.\n\n**Commands used**:\n```bash\n# Search entire home directory for AcpThread UUID\ngrep -r \"019bdbaf-bd91-7a30-b9fa-cafa271c5d3d\" ~ --include=\"*.json\" --include=\"*.jsonl\"\n```\n\n**Result**: Found match in Codex session file!\n```\n~/.codex/sessions/2026/01/20/rollout-2026-01-20T08-54-46-019bdbaf-bd91-7a30-b9fa-cafa271c5d3d.jsonl\n```\n\nThis confirmed that AcpThread UUIDs **ARE** the same as Codex session IDs.\n\n### Phase 4: Time-Based Signal Isolation\n\n**Goal**: Identify which files are from Zed Agent Panel vs CLI.\n\n**Methodology**: User confirmed no CLI usage for Gemini/Codex after 10pm, so any files modified after 10pm must be from Zed Agent Panel.\n\n**Commands used**:\n```bash\n# Find Gemini files modified after 10pm\nfind ~/.gemini -type f -newermt \"2026-02-06 22:00:00\"\n\n# Found sessions at 22:07, 22:09, 22:10, 22:11, 22:12\n# Confirmed these are from Zed Agent Panel\n```\n\n### Phase 5: Source Code Analysis\n\n**Goal**: Verify storage locations via adapter source code.\n\n**Files analyzed**:\n- `acps/claude-code-acp-main/src/acp-agent.ts`\n- `acps/codex-acp-main/src/codex_agent.rs`\n\n**Claude Code ACP** (lines 79-104):\n```typescript\nexport const CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR =\n  process.env.CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR ?? path.join(os.homedir(), \".claude\");\n\nfunction sessionFilePath(cwd: string, sessionId: string): string {\n  return path.join(CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, \"projects\", encodeProjectPath(cwd), `${sessionId}.jsonl`);\n}\n```\n\n**Codex ACP** (lines 375-376):\n```rust\nlet rollout_path =\n    find_thread_path_by_id_str(&self.config.codex_home, session_id.0.as_ref())\n```\n\nBoth adapters delegate storage to their underlying SDKs, which use the standard CLI locations.\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Findings\n\n### 1.

Locate storage directory:\n     - Gemini: ~/.gemini/tmp/*/chats/session-*.json\n     - Claude: ~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl\n     - Codex: ~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl\n\n  2. Parse the format:\n     - Gemini: Single JSON object with \"messages\" array\n     - Claude: JSONL with conversation turns\n     - Codex: JSONL with RolloutItem records\n\n  3. No need to distinguish CLI vs Zed - they use identical storage!\n```\n\n### Gemini Integration Notes\n\nGemini uses a different structure than Claude/Codex:\n- **Directory**: `~/.gemini/tmp/<project_hash>/chats/`\n- **Filename**: `session-<ISO-timestamp>-<short-uuid>.json`\n- **Format**: Single JSON object (not JSONL)\n- **Message types**: `\"user\"` and `\"gemini\"`\n- **Tool calls**: Embedded in `\"toolCalls\"` array with `result` field\n\n---\n\n## Files Examined\n\n| File | Format | Purpose |\n|------|--------|---------|\n| `~/Library/Application Support/Zed/threads/threads.db` | SQLite + zstd | First-party threads |\n| `~/Library/Application Support/Zed/db/0-stable/db.sqlite` | SQLite | UI state, agent references |\n| `~/.gemini/tmp/*/chats/*.json` | JSON | Gemini conversations |\n| `~/.codex/sessions/*/*.jsonl` | JSONL | Codex conversations |\n| `~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl` | JSONL | Claude Code conversations |\n| `acps/claude-code-acp-main/src/acp-agent.ts` | TypeScript | Claude Code adapter source |\n| `acps/codex-acp-main/src/codex_agent.rs` | Rust | Codex adapter source |\n\n---\n\n## Tools Used\n\n| Tool | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `sqlite3` | Query SQLite databases |\n| `zstd` | Decompress thread blobs (available at `/opt/homebrew/bin/zstd`) |\n| `find` | Locate files by modification time |\n| `grep` | Search for UUIDs across filesystems |\n| `python3` | Parse JSON for inspection |\n| `file` | Identify file types |\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n### What We CONFIRMED\n\n| Finding | Evidence Level |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Gemini** uses `~/.gemini/tmp/*/chats/` | ✅ **Empirically verified** - saw real files from Zed Agent Panel |\n| Adapters delegate to underlying SDKs | ✅ **Verified via source code** |\n| `threads.db` is first-party only | ✅ **Verified** - no AcpThread UUIDs present |\n| AcpThread UUIDs stored in `kv_store` | ✅ **Verified** - found 6 UUIDs |\n| One Codex UUID matched a session file | ✅ **Verified** - `019bdbaf-...` from January |\n\n### What We INFERRED (Need Empirical Verification)\n\n| Finding | Evidence Level |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Claude Code** uses `~/.claude/projects/` for Zed | ⚠️ **Source says yes** - but no real-time verification |\n| **Codex** uses `~/.codex/sessions/` for Zed | ⚠️ **Source + UUID match** - but no new session appeared after 10pm test |\n\n### Next Steps\n\nSee **`NEXT-SESSION-PLAN.md`** for the detailed plan:\n\n1. **Stream A**: Build Gemini adapter for `as-i-was-saying`\n2. **Stream B**: Locate Claude/Codex sessions from first principles using cross-agent probing\n\n---\n\n## Related Files\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `NEXT-SESSION-PLAN.md` | Living plan document for future sessions |\n| `find_agent_chats.py` | Discovery script used in investigation |\n| `acps/` | Cloned adapter source code |\n\n---\n\n## Session 2 Findings: Empirical Verification\n\n**Investigation Date**: 2026-02-07T11:25:00Z (Session 2)\n\nWe successfully located Codex sessions from today's Zed Agent Panel usage (post-11:25 AM EST).\n\n### 1. Codex Storage Verification (CONFIRMED)\n\nZed Agent Panel writes Codex sessions directly to the standard CLI location: `~/.codex/sessions/`.\n\n**Found Session Files**:\n- `~/.codex/sessions/2026/02/07/rollout-2026-02-07T11-08-28-019c38dc-9f5d-7100-91cd-c79bbba23493.jsonl` (Active Session)\n- `~/.codex/sessions/2026/02/07/rollout-2026-02-07T11-02-10-019c38d6-d96d-7571-99ce-2114eca2fc73.jsonl`\n\n**Correlation**:\n- The file timestamp (11:08:28) and modification time (11:29:21) align perfectly with the \"active\" Zed session observed.\n- This confirms that `codex-acp` writes to disk in real-time.\n\n### 2. Zed Database Persistence Gap\n\nWe investigated `~/Library/Application Support/Zed/db/0-stable/db.sqlite` to find the active session UUID (`019c38dc...`).\n\n- **Historical Sessions**: Found `019bdbaf...` (Jan 20) in `kv_store` -> `recent-agent-threads`.\n- **Active Session**: The UUID `019c38dc...` was **NOT** present in `kv_store`, `workspaces`, or `items` tables.\n\n**Conclusion**: Zed likely persists the thread ID to its internal database *lazily* (e.g., on thread switch or window close), whereas the agent adapter writes the conversation content to disk *eagerly*. **Extraction tools should not rely on Zed's `db.sqlite` for real-time session discovery.**\n\n### 3. Claude Code Storage (Verified by Proxy)\n\nThe investigation script also surfaced recent Claude activity matching the `~/.claude/projects/` pattern:\n- `~/.claude/projects/-Users-l-Dev-temp-zed-investigation/b0c256c1-75fa-444f-a2dc-097afdd755f2.jsonl` (Modified 11:27 AM)\n\nThis strongly confirms Claude follows the same pattern: standard CLI storage, real-time updates.\n\n### Updated Extraction Heuristic\n\nTo find the \"current\" Zed session for any agent:\n1.  **Do not** query Zed's DB for the active thread ID (it may be missing).\n2.  **Do** scan the agent's standard storage directory (`~/.codex/sessions`, `~/.claude/projects`).\n3.  Filter for files modified in the last X minutes.\n4.  Match against the current project context (Codex `cwd` metadata, Claude path encoding).\n\n---\n\n*Investigation ongoing. Report generated by Claude Code.*"

Zed Agent Panel writes directly to the standard Claude CLI project directory structure.\n2.  **Path Encoding**: The directory name `-Users-l-Dev-virdx-sandboxed` confirms the path encoding logic we saw in the source code (`encodeProjectPath` replacing `/` with `-`).\n3.  **Real-Time Persistence**: The file was updated immediately upon message receipt, confirming the `claude-code-acp` adapter writes to disk in real-time, just like the Codex adapter.\n\nI am updating the investigation log with these final confirmations.\n\n[Review raw grep results](command:read_file?file_path=%2FUsers%2Fl%2FDev%2Ftemp_zed_investigation%2Fzed-agent-storage-investigation.md)",

There is no separate Zed-specific storage for external agent threads.\n\n| Agent | CLI Storage | Zed Agent Panel Storage | Confirmed? |\n|-------|-------------|------------------------|------------|\n| **Gemini** | `~/.gemini/tmp/<hash>/chats/session-*.json` | Same | ✅ **Verified** |\n| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/projects/<path>/<uuid>.jsonl` | Same | ✅ **Verified (Session 2)** |\n| **Codex** | `~/.codex/sessions/<date>/rollout-*.jsonl` | Same | ✅ **Verified (Session 2)** |\n| **Zed First-Party** | `threads.db` (SQLite + zstd) | — | ✅ **Different** |\n\n### Key Architectural Insight\n\nGemini speaks **native ACP** to Zed, while Claude Code and Codex require **ACP adapters** (`claude-code-acp`, `codex-acp`). These adapters are thin wrappers that use the official SDKs, which handle all conversation persistence. This means:\n\n1. **Gemini**: Zed spawns Gemini CLI directly → writes to `~/.gemini/`\n2. **Claude Code**: Zed spawns `claude-code-acp` → uses Claude Agent SDK → writes to `~/.claude/`\n3. **Codex**: Zed spawns `codex-acp` → uses `codex_core` library → writes to `~/.codex/`\n\n---\n\n## Investigation Methodology\n\nThis section documents the reverse engineering approach used, for potential inclusion in the `as-i-was-saying` CLI tool.\n\n### Phase 1: Initial Directory Exploration\n\n**Goal**: Identify candidate storage locations.\n\n**Commands used**:\n```bash\n# List Zed's main data directory\nls -la ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Zed/\n\n# Found key directories:\n# - threads/threads.db (first-party threads)\n# - external_agents/ (agent binaries only)\n# - db/0-stable/db.sqlite (workspace state)\n```\n\n**Findings**:\n- `threads/threads.db` contains only first-party Zed Agent Panel threads\n- `external_agents/` contains binaries, NOT conversation data\n- `db/0-stable/db.sqlite` contains UI state (panel widths, recent thread references)\n\n### Phase 2: Database Schema Analysis\n\n**Goal**: Understand data structures.\n\n**Commands used**:\n```bash\n# Get threads.db schema\nsqlite3 ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Zed/threads/threads.db \".schema\"\n\n# Result:\nCREATE TABLE threads (\n    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    summary TEXT NOT NULL,\n    updated_at TEXT NOT NULL,\n    data_type TEXT NOT NULL,  -- Always \"zstd\"\n    data BLOB NOT NULL        -- zstd-compressed JSON\n);\n\n# Check kv_store for agent references\nsqlite3 ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Zed/db/0-stable/db.sqlite \\\n  \"SELECT key, value FROM kv_store WHERE key LIKE '%agent%';\"\n```\n\n**Critical Discovery**: Found `recent-agent-threads` in kv_store:\n```json\n[\n  {\"AcpThread\":\"87776303-3d7d-49e2-b0fa-c5a9aba97478\"},\n  {\"AcpThread\":\"c013694e-ad7d-44bd-bfbe-fa1a3596b0b2\"},\n  {\"AcpThread\":\"019bdbaf-bd91-7a30-b9fa-cafa271c5d3d\"},\n  ...\n]\n```\n\n### Phase 3: UUID Cross-Reference Search\n\n**Goal**: Locate where AcpThread UUIDs are actually stored.\n\n**Commands used**:\n```bash\n# Search entire home directory for AcpThread UUID\ngrep -r \"019bdbaf-bd91-7a30-b9fa-cafa271c5d3d\" ~ --include=\"*.json\" --include=\"*.jsonl\"\n```\n\n**Result**: Found match in Codex session file!\n```\n~/.codex/sessions/2026/01/20/rollout-2026-01-20T08-54-46-019bdbaf-bd91-7a30-b9fa-cafa271c5d3d.jsonl\n```\n\nThis confirmed that AcpThread UUIDs **ARE** the same as Codex session IDs.\n\n### Phase 4: Time-Based Signal Isolation\n\n**Goal**: Identify which files are from Zed Agent Panel vs CLI.\n\n**Methodology**: User confirmed no CLI usage for Gemini/Codex after 10pm, so any files modified after 10pm must be from Zed Agent Panel.\n\n**Commands used**:\n```bash\n# Find Gemini files modified after 10pm\nfind ~/.gemini -type f -newermt \"2026-02-06 22:00:00\"\n\n# Found sessions at 22:07, 22:09, 22:10, 22:11, 22:12\n# Confirmed these are from Zed Agent Panel\n```\n\n### Phase 5: Source Code Analysis\n\n**Goal**: Verify storage locations via adapter source code.\n\n**Files analyzed**:\n- `acps/claude-code-acp-main/src/acp-agent.ts`\n- `acps/codex-acp-main/src/codex_agent.rs`\n\n**Claude Code ACP** (lines 79-104):\n```typescript\nexport const CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR =\n  process.env.CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR ?? path.join(os.homedir(), \".claude\");\n\nfunction sessionFilePath(cwd: string, sessionId: string): string {\n  return path.join(CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, \"projects\", encodeProjectPath(cwd), `${sessionId}.jsonl`);\n}\n```\n\n**Codex ACP** (lines 375-376):\n```rust\nlet rollout_path =\n    find_thread_path_by_id_str(&self.config.codex_home, session_id.0.as_ref())\n```\n\nBoth adapters delegate storage to their underlying SDKs, which use the standard CLI locations.\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Findings\n\n### 1.

Source code (`codex_agent.rs:375-376`): Uses `config.codex_home` and `find_thread_path_by_id_str`\n2. UUID match: AcpThread `019bdbaf-bd91-7a30-b9fa-cafa271c5d3d` found in `~/.codex/sessions/2026/01/20/rollout-...-019bdbaf-bd91-7a30-b9fa-cafa271c5d3d.jsonl`\n\n### 5.

Locate storage directory:\n     - Gemini: ~/.gemini/tmp/*/chats/session-*.json\n     - Claude: ~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl\n     - Codex: ~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl\n\n  2. Parse the format:\n     - Gemini: Single JSON object with \"messages\" array\n     - Claude: JSONL with conversation turns\n     - Codex: JSONL with RolloutItem records\n\n  3. No need to distinguish CLI vs Zed - they use identical storage!\n```\n\n### Gemini Integration Notes\n\nGemini uses a different structure than Claude/Codex:\n- **Directory**: `~/.gemini/tmp/<project_hash>/chats/`\n- **Filename**: `session-<ISO-timestamp>-<short-uuid>.json`\n- **Format**: Single JSON object (not JSONL)\n- **Message types**: `\"user\"` and `\"gemini\"`\n- **Tool calls**: Embedded in `\"toolCalls\"` array with `result` field\n\n---\n\n## Files Examined\n\n| File | Format | Purpose |\n|------|--------|---------|\n| `~/Library/Application Support/Zed/threads/threads.db` | SQLite + zstd | First-party threads |\n| `~/Library/Application Support/Zed/db/0-stable/db.sqlite` | SQLite | UI state, agent references |\n| `~/.gemini/tmp/*/chats/*.json` | JSON | Gemini conversations |\n| `~/.codex/sessions/*/*.jsonl` | JSONL | Codex conversations |\n| `~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl` | JSONL | Claude Code conversations |\n| `acps/claude-code-acp-main/src/acp-agent.ts` | TypeScript | Claude Code adapter source |\n| `acps/codex-acp-main/src/codex_agent.rs` | Rust | Codex adapter source |\n\n---\n\n## Tools Used\n\n| Tool | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `sqlite3` | Query SQLite databases |\n| `zstd` | Decompress thread blobs (available at `/opt/homebrew/bin/zstd`) |\n| `find` | Locate files by modification time |\n| `grep` | Search for UUIDs across filesystems |\n| `python3` | Parse JSON for inspection |\n| `file` | Identify file types |\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n### What We CONFIRMED\n\n| Finding | Evidence Level |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Gemini** uses `~/.gemini/tmp/*/chats/` | ✅ **Empirically verified** - saw real files from Zed Agent Panel |\n| Adapters delegate to underlying SDKs | ✅ **Verified via source code** |\n| `threads.db` is first-party only | ✅ **Verified** - no AcpThread UUIDs present |\n| AcpThread UUIDs stored in `kv_store` | ✅ **Verified** - found 6 UUIDs |\n| One Codex UUID matched a session file | ✅ **Verified** - `019bdbaf-...` from January |\n\n### What We INFERRED (Need Empirical Verification)\n\n| Finding | Evidence Level |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Claude Code** uses `~/.claude/projects/` for Zed | ⚠️ **Source says yes** - but no real-time verification |\n| **Codex** uses `~/.codex/sessions/` for Zed | ⚠️ **Source + UUID match** - but no new session appeared after 10pm test |\n\n### Next Steps\n\nSee **`NEXT-SESSION-PLAN.md`** for the detailed plan:\n\n1. **Stream A**: Build Gemini adapter for `as-i-was-saying`\n2. **Stream B**: Locate Claude/Codex sessions from first principles using cross-agent probing\n\n---\n\n## Related Files\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `NEXT-SESSION-PLAN.md` | Living plan document for future sessions |\n| `find_agent_chats.py` | Discovery script used in investigation |\n| `acps/` | Cloned adapter source code |\n\n---\n\n## Session 2 Findings: Empirical Verification\n\n**Investigation Date**: 2026-02-07T11:25:00Z (Session 2)\n\nWe successfully located Codex sessions from today's Zed Agent Panel usage (post-11:25 AM EST).\n\n### 1. Codex Storage Verification (CONFIRMED)\n\nZed Agent Panel writes Codex sessions directly to the standard CLI location: `~/.codex/sessions/`.\n\n**Found Session Files**:\n- `~/.codex/sessions/2026/02/07/rollout-2026-02-07T11-08-28-019c38dc-9f5d-7100-91cd-c79bbba23493.jsonl` (Active Session)\n- `~/.codex/sessions/2026/02/07/rollout-2026-02-07T11-02-10-019c38d6-d96d-7571-99ce-2114eca2fc73.jsonl`\n\n**Correlation**:\n- The file timestamp (11:08:28) and modification time (11:29:21) align perfectly with the \"active\" Zed session observed.\n- This confirms that `codex-acp` writes to disk in real-time.\n\n### 2. Zed Database Persistence Gap\n\nWe investigated `~/Library/Application Support/Zed/db/0-stable/db.sqlite` to find the active session UUID (`019c38dc...`).\n\n- **Historical Sessions**: Found `019bdbaf...` (Jan 20) in `kv_store` -> `recent-agent-threads`.\n- **Active Session**: The UUID `019c38dc...` was **NOT** present in `kv_store`, `workspaces`, or `items` tables.\n\n**Conclusion**: Zed likely persists the thread ID to its internal database *lazily* (e.g., on thread switch or window close), whereas the agent adapter writes the conversation content to disk *eagerly*. **Extraction tools should not rely on Zed's `db.sqlite` for real-time session discovery.**\n\n### 3. Claude Code Storage (Verified by Proxy)\n\nThe investigation script also surfaced recent Claude activity matching the `~/.claude/projects/` pattern:\n- `~/.claude/projects/-Users-l-Dev-temp-zed-investigation/b0c256c1-75fa-444f-a2dc-097afdd755f2.jsonl` (Modified 11:27 AM)\n\nThis strongly confirms Claude follows the same pattern: standard CLI storage, real-time updates.\n\n### Updated Extraction Heuristic\n\nTo find the \"current\" Zed session for any agent:\n1.  **Do not** query Zed's DB for the active thread ID (it may be missing).\n2.  **Do** scan the agent's standard storage directory (`~/.codex/sessions`, `~/.claude/projects`).\n3.  Filter for files modified in the last X minutes.\n4.  Match against the current project context (Codex `cwd` metadata, Claude path encoding).\n\n---\n\n*Investigation ongoing. Report generated by Claude Code.*"

It provides the definitive strategy for extracting these chats, even if you are starting from scratch.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 The Golden Rule\n\n**Zed Agent Panel does NOT use a proprietary database for external agent conversations.**\n\nIt delegates storage to the underlying CLI adapters, which write to the standard configuration directories for each tool. **Trust the file system, not Zed's SQLite database.**\n\n## 📂 Storage Locations\n\n| Agent | Storage Path Pattern | Format | Notes |\n|-------|----------------------|--------|-------|\n| **Gemini** | `~/.gemini/tmp/<hash>/chats/session-*.json` | JSON | Native ACP integration. |\n| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/<uuid>.jsonl` | JSONL | Path encoding replaces `/` with `-`. |\n| **Codex** | `~/.codex/sessions/<date>/rollout-*.jsonl` | JSONL | Subdirectories by date. |\n\n### Versions Verified\n- **Gemini**: 0.26.0 (CLI) / 0.27.2 (Adapter)\n- **Claude Code**: 2.1.7 (CLI) / 0.16.0 (Adapter)\n- **Codex**: 0.93.0 (CLI) / 0.9.2 (Adapter)\n\n---\n\n## 🕵️‍♂️ Investigation Strategy (How to Redo This)\n\nIf these locations change in the future, follow this \"First Principles\" protocol:\n\n### 1. Time-Based Signal Isolation\n1.  **Stop** all CLI usage.\n2.  **Mark** the current timestamp.\n3.  **Start** a new session in Zed Agent Panel.\n4.  **Send** a unique \"probe\" message (e.g., `PROBE-BICYCLE-DINOSAUR`).\n5.  **Scan** for files modified after your mark:\n    ```bash\n    find ~ -type f -newermt \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\" -not -path \"*/.*git*\"\n    ```\n6.  **Grep** the recent files for your probe keyword:\n    ```bash\n    grep -r \"PROBE-BICYCLE-DINOSAUR\" <search_results>\n    ```\n\n### 2. Verify Adapter Source Code\nZed uses adapters to bridge ACP (Agent Client Protocol) to external CLIs.\n- Check `external_agents/` in Zed's Application Support folder.\n- Look for `src/acp-agent.ts` (TypeScript) or `src/lib.rs` (Rust).\n- Search for `config_dir`, `home_dir`, or file write operations.\n\n### 3.
