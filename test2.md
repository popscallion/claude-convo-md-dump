# Context

  We just finished implementing the
  spec-orchestration protocol (Workstreams 2-5).
  The previous session (WS1) updated AGENTS.md.
  This session created the skills, agents, and
  infrastructure.

  ## Files to Read First

  1. `specs/spec-orchestration/DECISIONS-2026-01-
  21.md` — Philosophy + decision rationale
  2.
  `specs/spec-orchestration/full-conversation.md`
   — WS1 planning conversation
  3. `specs/spec-orchestration/full-conversation-
  ws2to5.md` — WS2-5 implementation conversation
  4. `~/.claude/plans/hidden-forging-leaf.md` —
  Full implementation plan

  ## What Was Built

  | Artifact | Location |
  |----------|----------|
  | Core protocol |
  `.claude/skills/spec-orchestration/SKILL.md` |
  | Dependency analysis | `.claude/skills/spec-de
  pendency-analysis/SKILL.md` |
  | Inbox triage |
  `.claude/skills/inbox-triage/SKILL.md` |
  | Agents |
  `.claude/agents/spec-dependency-analyzer.md`,
  `inbox-interpreter.md` |
  | Command | `.claude/commands/inbox.md` |
  | Style guide |
  `docs/PURE-FUNCTIONS-RUNES-PATTERN.md` |
  | Infrastructure | `_INBOX/` folder
  (gitignored) |
  | AGENTS.md | Updated sections: Code Style,
  Testing Ladder, Checkpoint Protocol, _INBOX
  Protocol |

  ## Your Task

  **Interactive testing guide**: Help me test the
   new spec-orchestration system in a second
  terminal running Claude Code. I will:
  1. Open a second Claude Code instance
  2. Try various scenarios (enter plan mode, skip
   questions, test /inbox, etc.)
  3. Paste logs/outputs back to you for
  troubleshooting

  **You should**:
  - Know what behavior to expect from reading the
   skill docs
  - Guide me through test scenarios one by one
  - Diagnose issues based on logs I paste
  - Suggest fixes if something isn't working

  ## Test Scenarios to Cover

  1. **Plan mode interview** — Enter plan mode,
  verify interview activates
  2. **Trivial escape** — Say "this is trivial",
  verify it offers to skip
  3. **Skip-to-assume** — Give terse responses,
  verify assumptions are made
  4. **Checkpoint magic words** — Ask "how much
  context?", verify status report
  5. **_INBOX workflow** — Drop file in _INBOX/,
  invoke /inbox, verify triage
  6. **State machine co-evolution** — Start an
  interactive spec, verify machine sketch

  Refer to the skill files for expected output
  formats and behavior.

I'll help you test the spec-orchestration system! Let me first read the skill files to understand the expected behaviors, then guide you through each scenario.
